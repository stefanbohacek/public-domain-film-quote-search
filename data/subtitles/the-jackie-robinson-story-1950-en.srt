00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:04,901
<i>clang-clang.</i>

374
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,669
How many of them did you say?

375
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,871
<i>(Jackie) Sixteen.</i>

376
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:11,140
Well, I could make you
16 beef sandwiches,

377
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,275
and maybe the same
in ham and egg.

378
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:14,276
<i>That'd do you?</i>

379
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:15,445
Swell.

380
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:17,814
How about some fried potatoes
on the side, Chef?

381
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:18,815
<i>Yep.</i>

382
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,148
<i>Take about 20 minutes.</i>

383
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:21,651
Thanks.

384
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:25,821
Do you suppose we
could wash up a bit?

385
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:27,958
Sorry, it's out of order.

386
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,072
Say, Ernie.

387
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:44,073
Yeah?

388
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:46,208
When are they gonna
give me a contract?

389
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,275
Contract?

390
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,679
You want to know
about contracts?

391
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,979
Yes!

392
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,180
Say, fellas!

393
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:54,048
This man wants to know
about contracts.

394
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:55,051
Contracts?

395
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,919
Fix you right up
with the information.

396
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,887
Yes, sir, contracts.

397
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:00,589
Tell him about that, boy.

398
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,458
You want a contract
with the Panthers?

399
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,193
The first thing
you've got to do...

400
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:07,063
is borrow some money
from the boss.

401
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:09,733
Then you got a job
until he gets paid back.

402
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:12,133
If you can get him
to lend the geetus.

403
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,736
Keep your eye on the grandstand.

404
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,871
Got a good day
and a good crowd...

405
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:17,739
That's the time to hit 'im up.

406
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,074
Owe him a week's salary...

407
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,676
You got a one-week contract.

408
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:21,744
Owe him for two...

409
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,346
You got a two-week contract.

410
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:24,346
The<i> oss-bay.</i>

411
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:26,748
Get out of here
and get a little work.

412
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:28,251
Come on!

413
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:36,559
<i>Fwhee-ooohh.</i>

414
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,363
Strike two!

415
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:44,600
<i>(umpire) You're out!</i>

416
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,468
Well, that's the ball game.

417
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,137
That Robinson sure had
a good day, didn't he?

418
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,639
Sure did!

419
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:03,885
<i>(man) Robinson!</i>

420
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:05,720
Robinson, can I see you?

421
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:07,256
I'm Clyde Sukeforth...

422
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,923
of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

423
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,793
I'd like to talk for a minute.

424
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:11,794
What about?

425
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:12,894
About you.

426
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,662
Branch Rickey
would like to see you.

427
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:15,764
He would?

428
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:18,400
Do you think you could
get away for a day?

429
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:19,468
I guess so.

430
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,336
Good... I'll take care
of the tickets.

431
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:23,471
Now you meet me
at the Union Station

432
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:24,640
at 7 o'clock.

433
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:25,873
The New York gate.

434
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:26,875
Is that okay?

435
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:29,113
Sure... that's great.

436
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,117
<i>(Ernie) Hey, who's your friend?</i>

437
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:35,118
Scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

438
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,985
Signed me for the
New York Yankees.

439
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:38,588
Were gonna give me a bonus

440
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:40,188
to pitch for the Red Sox.

441
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,523
And then his keeper came.

442
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:43,291
Some guys think they're funny.

443
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:46,296
Yeah, you can say that again.

444
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,134

00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,886
Coming!

453
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,825
I don't understand
this, Robinson!

454
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:19,460
Don't you have a good mind?

455
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:20,795
Or are you playing coy?

456
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:23,199
I waited for you till
I missed the train.

457
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,800
What's the idea?

458
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:27,203

No, sir... not exactly.

I heard you were starting

474
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:25,861
a colored ball team.

No, you were
brought here to play

477
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,565
with the Brooklyn organization.

478
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,568
<i>Montreal, to start with.</i>

479
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:38,673
Me?

480
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,676
Play for Montreal?

481
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,779
I want to win pennants
and we need ballplayers.

482
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,782
The war set us back a little.

483
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:49,083
<i>So, three years ago,
the Brooklyn Dodger management</i>

484
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:51,653
<i>decided to scout
untapped sources of supply...</i>

485
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:54,422
Mexico, Cuba, all the
Latin American countries,

486
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:56,257
and our own country too.

487
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,692
That right, Clyde?

488
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,562
From coast to coast.

489
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:03,064
Yes... for players
who can help us win.

490
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:05,667
Many of the men
we saw were good.

491
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,035
Some had great promise...

492
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,937
Like you.

493
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:11,073
<i>Do you think
you can do it, Jackie?</i>

494
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:14,042
<i>Make good in organized baseball?</i>

495
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:16,711
If I got the chance.

496
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,814
There's more here
than just playing.

497
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,483
I wish it just meant runs
and hits and errors...

498
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:23,887
The things you can see
in a box score.

499
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:27,389
Heh... a box score.

500
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,493
You know, a box score is
really democratic, Jackie.

501
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:32,361
It doesn't say how big you are

502
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,964
or how your father
voted in the last election,

503
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,099
or what church you attend.

504
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,770
<i>It just tells you
what kind of a ballplayer</i>

505
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,236
<i>you were</i> that<i> day.</i>

506
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:43,572
Well, isn't that what counts?

507
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,175
It's all that ought to count.

508
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:48,276
And maybe someday
it's all that will count.

509
00:22:48,277 --> 00:22:50,411
That's why we brought you here.

510
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,881
I want to see if we can make
a start in that direction.

511
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:56,785
It'll take<i> a lot</i> of courage.

512
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:59,622
Yeah... it sure will.

513
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:00,956
It might take more courage

514
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:02,824
for the organization
than for you, Jackie.

515
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:05,160
Have you thought of that?

516
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:06,495
I haven't thought of anything.

517
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,330
It's all so sudden...

518
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:10,466
Kind of hits me
straight between the eyes.

519
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,167
Just relax, boy.

520
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:13,636
There's plenty of time.

521
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,938
Pull up a chair...
Make yourself comfortable.

522
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:17,440
Thanks.

523
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:21,676
We're tackling
something big here, Jackie.

524
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:25,581
If we fail, no one
will try again for 20 years.

525
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,082
But if we succeed...

526
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,650
If we succeed, Brooklyn
will win a pennant.

527
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,019
Yes, that too.

528
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,689
But we're dealing
with rights here...

529
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,824
The right of any American
to play baseball...

530
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:37,326
The American game.

531
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,394
Do you think
he's our boy, Clyde?

532
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,264
Well, he can run, he can hit,

533
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:43,331
and he can field.

534
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:45,433
But can he take it?

535
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:47,570
That, I don't know.

536
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,404
What do you think, Jackie?

537
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:50,605
Well, I can try.

538
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:51,939
Think you've got guts enough

539
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,074
to play the game no matter
what happens?

540
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,410
They'll shout insults at you.

541
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:57,012
They'll come
into you spikes first.

542
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:58,580
They'll throw at your head.

543
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,183
They've been throwin' at my head

544
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:01,784
for a long time, Mr. Rickey.

545
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:04,518
Suppose I'm a player
in the heat of a game.

546
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,388
I collide with you
at second base.

547
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:08,189
And when I get up, I say,

548
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,392
"You dirty black so-and-so!"

549
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:12,294
What do you do?

550
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,429
Mr. Rickey, do you
want a ballplayer

551
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,765
who's afraid to fight back?

552
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,900
I want a ballplayer

this job with base hits,

00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:23,604
stolen bases, and fielding
ground balls, Jackie.

556

557
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,342

and I'm hotheaded.

558
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:28,945
I want to win this game.

559
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:30,545
I go into you spikes first.

560
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,413
You jab the ball in my ribs.

561
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:33,480
The umpire says, "Out."

562
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,083

563

564
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,286

565
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,388

566

567
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:43,859
Mr. Rickey, I've got two cheeks.

568
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,331
Good!

569
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:51,766
You under contract
to the Black Panthers?

570
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,369
No, sir, we don't
have contracts.

571
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,704

572
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:56,037

573
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:57,372
No, sir, none at all.

574
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:58,574
All right.

575
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,909
Clyde will give you
a contract before you leave.

576
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,244

Yes, sir, she's in California.

581
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:13,987
Call her up... ask her advice.

582

remember one thing.

585
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:21,063
No matter what happens
on the ball field,

586
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:23,164

I'm good enough to...

657
00:27:57,652 --> 00:27:59,520
Reverend, it means
that a colored man

658
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:01,922
will be able to play
on the same field

659
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:04,125

669

been proud of that,

930

thought baseball

931

00:58:58,613 --> 00:58:59,746
They don't, huh?

1281
00:58:59,747 --> 00:59:01,615
Get hold of the men that signed

1282
00:59:01,616 --> 00:59:04,052
and bring 'em
to my room at 8 o'clock.

1283
00:59:04,053 --> 00:59:06,053
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1284
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:10,091
And you call
yourselves Americans.

1285
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:13,695
Who's your leader?

1286
00:59:14,694 --> 00:59:16,698
Who started this?

1287
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:20,333
Tony, you signed that petition.

1288
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:21,668
<i>You want to deny Robinson</i>

1289
00:59:21,669 --> 00:59:23,202
<i>the right to play baseball?</i>

1290
00:59:23,203 --> 00:59:25,604
I just don't wanna be
on the same team.

1291
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:27,206
You born in the United States?

1292
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:28,206
Yes, sir.

1293
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:29,809
Your parents...
Where were they born?

1294
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:30,878
My father... in Italy.

1295
00:59:30,879 --> 00:59:31,879
And your mother?

1296
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,211
She was born in Italy.

1297
00:59:33,212 --> 00:59:35,347
They came to America
before you were born.

1298
00:59:35,348 --> 00:59:37,217
Your father...
What did he work at

1299
00:59:37,218 --> 00:59:38,818
when he came to this country?

1300
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:40,153
On the railroad... a laborer.

1301
00:59:40,154 --> 00:59:42,289
<i>Your mother... did she work too?</i>

1302
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:45,325
She, uh, she worked
in a shirt factory.

1303
00:59:45,326 --> 00:59:47,528
Your father was
an immigrant laborer.

1304
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:49,929
Did anybody get up
a petition to keep him

1305
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,597
from working on the railroad?

1306
00:59:51,598 --> 00:59:53,298
Not that I know of.

1307
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,168
Did anybody try
to stop your mother

1308
00:59:55,169 --> 00:59:57,739
from working
in the shirt factory?

1309
00:59:58,705 --> 01:00:00,305
Your parents came
to this country

1310
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:02,441
and were allowed
to work as free people.

1311
01:00:02,442 --> 01:00:03,776
And yet, you... a child

1312
01:00:03,777 --> 01:00:05,112
and beneficiary
of that freedom...

1313
01:00:05,113 --> 01:00:06,711
Want to deny
the same opportunity

1314
01:00:06,712 --> 01:00:08,048
to an American whose parents

1315
01:00:08,049 --> 01:00:09,449
<i>and grandparents
and great-grandparents</i>

1316
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:12,017
<i>have been in this country
for 200 years.</i>

1317
01:00:12,018 --> 01:00:15,156
<i>Is that right?</i>

1318
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:19,992
How about you, Dalby?

1319
01:00:19,993 --> 01:00:21,327
Would you have the courage

1320
01:00:21,328 --> 01:00:23,195
to tell Robinson
that to his face

1321
01:00:23,196 --> 01:00:25,932
<i>here, behind closed doors?</i>

1322
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:27,534
Tell him that he can't play

1323
01:00:27,535 --> 01:00:29,369
on the same team with you?

1324
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:31,238
<i>Tell him you're
not gonna let him</i>

1325
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:33,139
<i>earn his living as a ballplayer?</i>

1326
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,242
<i>Answer me, sir!</i>

1327
01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:37,910
Mr. Rickey,
I... wasn't thinkin'.

1328
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:39,579
I didn't think.

1329
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,914
And that, sir, explains why

1330
01:00:40,915 --> 01:00:43,418
your teammates
call you "Ironhead."

1331
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:47,021
Yes, sir.

1332
01:00:48,455 --> 01:00:51,324
Karpen, you've been
in baseball a long time.

1333
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:54,193
Do you want to play
on the Dodgers with Robinson?

1334
01:00:54,194 --> 01:00:55,760
No, sir, I don't.

1335
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:59,231
<i>Will you</i> play with Robinson?

1336
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:00,767
I'd rather not, sir.

1337
01:01:00,768 --> 01:01:02,635
Would you like
to have your contract

1338
01:01:02,636 --> 01:01:04,438
transferred to another club?

1339
01:01:04,439 --> 01:01:05,805
Yes, sir, I would.

1340
01:01:05,806 --> 01:01:09,142
I<i> may</i> accommodate you, sir.

1341
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:10,644
All right, men.

1342
01:01:10,645 --> 01:01:13,412
I respect your right
to petition.

1343
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:15,648
But I do question
and I will fight

1344
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:17,483
any petition
that denies any American

1345
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:19,084
the right to earn his living

1346
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:21,220
in a game that is
supposed to represent

1347
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:24,057
the democratic principles
of sportsmanship and fair play!

1348
01:01:24,058 --> 01:01:25,892
Do you understand me?!

1349
01:01:25,893 --> 01:01:27,862
<i>- (Tony) Yes, sir.
- (Dalby) Yes, sir.</i>

1350
01:01:27,865 --> 01:01:29,863
That's all for tonight.

1351
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:36,568
Your suits are in your lockers.

1352
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,073
There's a ball game tomorrow.

1353
01:01:40,073 --> 01:01:43,443
I hope I'll see you there...

1354
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:45,446
in uniform.

1355
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:59,460
Jackie.

1356
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:01,694
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1357
01:02:01,695 --> 01:02:02,762
Jackie, Montreal is starting

1358
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:05,231
a 12-game series
with the Dodgers.

1359
01:02:05,232 --> 01:02:06,233
Yes, sir.

1360
01:02:06,234 --> 01:02:07,234
Take this.

1361
01:02:07,235 --> 01:02:08,834
During that series I want you

1362
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:11,137
to play first base for Montreal.

1363
01:02:11,138 --> 01:02:12,637
First base?

1364
01:02:12,638 --> 01:02:14,506
Mr. Rickey, I've never
played first base.

1365
01:02:14,507 --> 01:02:16,209
We're protected
at second base, Jackie.

1366
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,311
We've got Burwell.

1367
01:02:18,312 --> 01:02:20,912
Brooklyn can use
a good first baseman.

1368
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:22,914
Oh, I see.

1369
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,517
Go out there and show 'em.

1370
01:02:24,518 --> 01:02:25,952
Run their legs off.

1371
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:27,253
Yes, sir!

1372
01:02:27,254 --> 01:02:29,188
I sure will!

1373
01:02:29,189 --> 01:02:32,192
Phump-phump-phump

1374
01:02:36,163 --> 01:02:37,697

1375
01:02:37,698 --> 01:02:39,499

Make him pitch to ya.

1380
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:50,642

01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,853

All right, Lefty, come on, boy.

1387
01:03:09,297 --> 01:03:10,798
Whack!

A<i> great</i> play!

1390
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:21,108
Yeah, but a little dangerous.

1391
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:22,441
I think I'll move over

1392
01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:24,444
to the Brooklyn side.

1393
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:29,650
<i>(Rickey) Karpen.</i>

off the Brooklyn team?

1396
01:03:33,553 --> 01:03:34,388
Yes, sir.

1397
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:36,255
Then why do you keep feeding him

1398
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:37,324
those big fat ones?

1399
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:39,191
I ain't feedin' him no fat ones.

1400
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:41,327
Then how'd he get
three hits off you?

1401
01:03:41,328 --> 01:03:42,394
Just lucky.

1402
01:03:42,395 --> 01:03:43,528
All right, Karpen.

1403
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,130
He's up first in this inning.

1404
01:03:45,131 --> 01:03:47,534
If you want to keep him
off the team,

1405
01:03:47,535 --> 01:03:49,670
I'll tell you how you can do it.

1406
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:50,671
Strike him out.

1407
01:03:50,672 --> 01:03:52,672

Greetings from Ebbets Field.

1427
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,867
They call it big league
baseball, folks,

1428
01:04:54,868 --> 01:04:56,468
because you've got to be bigger

1429
01:04:56,469 --> 01:04:58,271
and better to stay up here.

1430
01:04:58,272 --> 01:05:00,106
That's the problem
confronting Jackie Robinson

1431
01:05:00,107 --> 01:05:02,508
at this very minute
as he goes to bat

1432
01:05:02,509 --> 01:05:04,910
for the first time
in a big league game.

1433
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:07,579
Oh, yes, I know he's done
all right in training...

1434
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,481
I've seen the papers too.

1435
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:11,217
But that was only practice.

1436
01:05:11,218 --> 01:05:14,352
From now on, it's for keeps.

1437
01:05:14,353 --> 01:05:16,755
There's a little man
upstairs in the press box

1438
01:05:16,756 --> 01:05:18,657
who's known among other things

1439
01:05:18,658 --> 01:05:20,492
as the official scorer.

1440
01:05:20,493 --> 01:05:22,295
He watches like a hawk.

1441
01:05:22,296 --> 01:05:24,329
He marks down everything.

1442
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,199
He'll make a mark for every move

1443
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,434
that Jackie Robinson makes...

1444
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:29,302
Good or bad.

1445
01:05:29,303 --> 01:05:31,170
And not only
the official scorer's eyes

1446
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:32,505
are on the Negro rookie...

1447
01:05:32,506 --> 01:05:34,372
the whole world is waiting.

1448
01:05:34,373 --> 01:05:35,874
Everybody wants to know

1449
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,343
if Branch Rickey
has made a mistake.

1450
01:05:38,344 --> 01:05:41,880
Will they be able to say
"I told you so"?

1451
01:05:41,881 --> 01:05:43,884
Let's see.

1452
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,142

1457
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:24,356
So what?

1458
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:25,958
What do you mean "so what?"

1459
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:28,193
Sit down.

1460
01:06:45,678 --> 01:06:46,679
Ooh!

1461
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,814
You'll lose your
tightness in a few days.

1462
01:06:48,815 --> 01:06:50,083
It's nerves, that's all.

1463
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:52,851
I just can't get on
to shifting my feet.

1464
01:06:52,852 --> 01:06:54,452
I missed the bag
completely today

1465
01:06:54,453 --> 01:06:55,521
in the third inning.

1466
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:57,824
If they'd only let you
play second base.

1467
01:06:57,825 --> 01:07:00,059
We've got Burwell
at second base.

1468
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,660
First is where they need me.

1469
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:04,063
If you can't get it
and it worries you...

1470
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,298
It's got me worried.

1471
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:07,534
And it's got me where
I'm not hitting, either.

1472
01:07:07,535 --> 01:07:09,336
You're still
their best base runner.

1473
01:07:09,337 --> 01:07:11,204
They can't take
that away from you.

1474
01:07:11,205 --> 01:07:13,439
Yeah, but you can't steal first.

1475
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,641
Owww!

1476
01:07:14,642 --> 01:07:16,242
What've you got in those hands?

1477
01:07:16,243 --> 01:07:17,242
Steel springs?

1478
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:19,010
They're nurse's hands, remember?

1479
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:21,146
They'd better nurse me
out of this slump,

1480
01:07:21,147 --> 01:07:24,751
or Mr. Rickey will be
lookin' for a new boy.

1481
01:07:27,386 --> 01:07:28,720
Don't wait till you feel

1482
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:30,055
the bag under your foot.

1483
01:07:30,056 --> 01:07:31,657
Do it all in one motion.

1484
01:07:31,658 --> 01:07:33,793
I just can't get the hang of it.

1485
01:07:33,794 --> 01:07:35,296
Try another one.

1486
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:40,465
That's worse.

1487
01:07:40,466 --> 01:07:43,602
<i>(player) Here, let
me show you how.</i>

1488
01:07:43,603 --> 01:07:45,204
You almost had it last time.

1489
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:46,539
When you miss the bag,

1490
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,675
you kick back for it like this.

1491
01:07:49,676 --> 01:07:51,142
Here, you try it.

1492
01:07:51,143 --> 01:07:52,677
Thanks.

1493
01:07:58,051 --> 01:07:59,052
That's the idea.

1494
01:07:59,053 --> 01:08:02,455
All you have to do
is practice now.

1495
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:06,659
Why'd he want to do that?

1496
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,061
If I can't make
the grade at first base,

1497
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:11,196
he'd have his old job back.

1498
01:08:11,197 --> 01:08:13,700
He's a team player, Jackie.

1499
01:08:24,178 --> 01:08:27,612
Yeah, and the weatherman
apologizes for the recent rain.

1500
01:08:27,613 --> 01:08:29,348
Well, let's get serious, folks.

1501
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:30,950
They can't say
that Branch Rickey

1502
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:32,852
hasn't given Jackie Robinson

1503
01:08:32,853 --> 01:08:34,586
a king-sized opportunity

1504
01:08:34,587 --> 01:08:36,923
in staying
in big league baseball.

1505
01:08:36,924 --> 01:08:38,624
On that last road trip,

1506
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,027
when the California boy
wasn't hitting too well,

1507
01:08:41,028 --> 01:08:42,896
some of the
out-of-town sportswriters

1508
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:45,296
said that Jackie
should have been out of there.

1509
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:47,433
He had a little trouble
with first base...

1510
01:08:47,434 --> 01:08:49,302
Playing it and reaching it.

1511
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:52,506
He just couldn't come up
with that extra base hit.

1512
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:55,107
Right now, I see Jackie
stepping into the box.

1513
01:08:56,777 --> 01:08:59,911
All right, bring it in
out there.

1514
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:00,915
Here we go!

1515
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:02,915
Ball!

1516
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:04,417
Come on, babe.

1517
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,588
All right, let's go.

1518
01:09:07,589 --> 01:09:09,090
Here it is.

1519
01:09:10,991 --> 01:09:12,224
Whack!

1520
01:09:12,225 --> 01:09:14,125
Thattaboy, Jackie.

1521
01:09:14,126 --> 01:09:15,827
What happened to you?!

1522
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:25,036
Keep your
fingers crossed, folks.

1523
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:27,173
It may be that the rookie,
Jackie Robinson,

1524
01:09:27,174 --> 01:09:29,675
is a big league
ballplayer after all.

1525
01:09:29,676 --> 01:09:31,811
But he had us
all worried, didn't he?

1526
01:09:31,812 --> 01:09:34,481
Going to the plate 19
straight times without a hit.

1527
01:09:34,482 --> 01:09:36,350
But the pendulum
can swing both ways,

1528
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:38,483
and it may be
that Jackie has started

1529
01:09:38,484 --> 01:09:39,817
on a hitting streak now.

1530
01:09:39,818 --> 01:09:42,388
In baseball, it's not
<i>who</i> or what you are,

1531
01:09:42,389 --> 01:09:45,057
but can you play the game?

1532
01:09:45,058 --> 01:09:48,062
And Jackie Robinson
sure is playing it.

1533
01:09:49,964 --> 01:09:50,964
Whack!

1534
01:09:53,867 --> 01:09:56,067
Well, Dalby, he's hitting again.

1535
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:59,072
Yeah, we might win
the pennant now.

1536
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:05,045
Whack!

1537
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:12,051
Safe!

1538
01:10:17,556 --> 01:10:19,157
You're out of the game, Kelly!

1539
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:20,861
He knocked me down!

1540
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:25,565
Didn't you spike the
Cub shortstop last week?

1541
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:26,631
That was an accident.

1542
01:10:26,632 --> 01:10:27,967
So was this an accident.

1543
01:10:27,968 --> 01:10:29,567
They're all accidents!

1544
01:10:29,568 --> 01:10:31,903
Let's get out there!

1545
01:10:31,904 --> 01:10:33,539
Next time I get on base,

1546
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,607
watch out for spikes.

1547
01:10:34,608 --> 01:10:35,676
Get off the field!

1548
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:37,543
You better get Robinson
off the field.

1549
01:10:37,544 --> 01:10:38,611
Yeah, get him off.

1550
01:10:38,612 --> 01:10:39,946
Get him out of here.

1551
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:41,546
Anybody lookin' for
a little argument?

1552
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:42,814
Yes, I am!

1553
01:10:42,815 --> 01:10:44,849
You're out of the game too.

1554
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:45,851
Who me?

1555
01:10:45,852 --> 01:10:46,852
Yes, you.

1556
01:10:46,853 --> 01:10:47,921
What's the big idea,

1557
01:10:47,922 --> 01:10:48,921
you dirty little...

1558
01:10:48,922 --> 01:10:49,987
Get off the field

1559
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:51,590
or it's gonna cost you plenty!

1560
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:53,259
<i>(Dalby) Let's get out of here!</i>

1561
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,227
<i>(Karpen) Let me at that guy!</i>

1562
01:10:55,228 --> 01:10:57,929

1563
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:08,241
Whack!

<i>Come on, Jackie.</i>

1565
01:11:09,576 --> 01:11:11,177
<i>Go ahead, go on!</i>

1566
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,672
Hey, Mike!

1567
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:41,307
What's happened to my clothes?

1568
01:11:41,308 --> 01:11:42,642
I got them over here.

1569
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:45,978
Come here,
I'll show them to you.

1570
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:48,179
I got a locker for ya.

1571
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,683
Thanks.

1572
01:11:56,023 --> 01:12:04,023
♪

1573
01:12:12,272 --> 01:12:14,674
The Brooklyn Dodgers
really are pouring it on now.

1574
01:12:14,675 --> 01:12:16,810
They're up at bat
with one run behind

1575
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:17,977
in the ninth inning

1576
01:12:17,978 --> 01:12:20,079
and Brooklyn hearts today
have skipped more beats

1577
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,780
than an absent-minded policeman.

1578
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:24,782
Well, this boy's set fire
to the league since midseason

1579
01:12:24,783 --> 01:12:27,518
when he hit safely
in 21 straight games,

1580
01:12:27,519 --> 01:12:29,455
missing the league record
by one.

1581
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:32,290
He's laid down
42 successful bunts...

1582
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,692
A prodigious number.

1583
01:12:33,693 --> 01:12:35,294
He's a cinch to be voted

1584
01:12:35,295 --> 01:12:36,894
the Rookie of the Year,
incidentally.

1585
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:38,763
Now we've got
a runner on second,

1586
01:12:38,764 --> 01:12:39,799
the tying run,

1587
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,401
and Jackie Robinson
is at the plate.

1588
01:12:42,402 --> 01:12:43,768
He can't bunt now.

1589
01:12:43,769 --> 01:12:45,437
He's got to hit straight away.

1590
01:12:45,438 --> 01:12:46,504
There are two out.

1591
01:12:46,505 --> 01:12:48,641
Come on!

1592
01:12:48,642 --> 01:12:50,143

Oh, go on!

1596
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:56,382
Get up there and hit the ball.

1597
01:12:59,385 --> 01:13:03,223

Whack!

1605
01:13:44,831 --> 01:13:47,766
The tying run scored on Jackie's
base hit to center field

1606
01:13:47,767 --> 01:13:49,634
and it's a new ball game now

1607
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:51,236
with Jackie Robinson
on second base

1608
01:13:51,237 --> 01:13:52,670
representing the winning run.

1609
01:13:52,671 --> 01:13:54,939

1614

And where's my aspirin?

1615
01:14:33,246 --> 01:14:34,513
That was my boy!

1616
01:14:34,514 --> 01:14:36,682
Did you see my Jackie?

1617
01:14:36,683 --> 01:14:37,750
Yeah, I sure did.

1618
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:39,885
Ah, he is some boy!

1619
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:52,832
Jackie, congratulations.

1620
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,099
Thank you, sir... same to you.

1621
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,634
By the way, Mr. Rickey,

1622
01:14:56,635 --> 01:14:58,370
there's something bothering me.

1623
01:14:58,371 --> 01:15:00,372
About that invitation
to Washington...

1624
01:15:00,373 --> 01:15:02,241
Do you really think I should go?

1625
01:15:02,242 --> 01:15:03,808
Yes, Jackie, I do.

1626
01:15:03,809 --> 01:15:06,178
To Washington... to the Senate,

1627
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:07,513
to the House of Representatives,

1628
01:15:07,514 --> 01:15:09,082
to the American people.

1629
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,715
You've earned
the right to speak.

1630
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:13,085
They want you to speak...

1631
01:15:13,086 --> 01:15:14,753
about things on your mind,

1632
01:15:14,754 --> 01:15:16,354
about a threat to peace

1633
01:15:16,355 --> 01:15:18,891
that's on
everybody's mind, Jackie.

1634
01:15:18,892 --> 01:15:21,192

1
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,749
John, let's go to bed.

2
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,459
I want to take the boat out alone.

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,962
- I'll be up later.
- No, I'll go with you.

4
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,356
John...

5
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,902
That will is no good.

6
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,240
Your mother's still alive.
We can talk her into changing it.

7
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,660
You were always too greedy, Louise.

8
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:20,705
I just don't like to see her
exploiting you.

9
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,085
Honey, she's leaving
all of your family's money to charity

10
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:30,840
in the name of this mysterious Kathleen.
It's ridiculous.

11
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,508
Your mother is crazy.

12
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,927
You don't know anything about it.

13
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,263
I know that music's terrible.

14
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,527
John, you're rowing too hard. Let me row.

15
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,614
You're concerned about me, Louise.

16
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,033
- Is it my heart?
- Stop it.

17
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,328
You're only a member of the family
as long as you're my wife.

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,957
If I die before Mother,
you're a stranger...

19
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,086
entitled to nothing.

20
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:14,884
Now you've done it.

21
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,057
- Where are the pills?
- In-- In the coat.

22
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,899
It's empty, you idiot!

23
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,288
Row faster, Louise.

24
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,000
If I die, there's nothing in it for you.

25
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,920
Shut up.

26
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:58,928
John?

27
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,515
John!

28
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,449
Now what do I do?

29
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,411
I got to get rid of him.

30
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,426
I'll have to get rid of his things,

31
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,513
say he went back to New York
on business or something.

32
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,562
"Mother...

33
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,440
I am terribly sorry,

34
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,111
but I have received

35
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,737
an urgent...

36
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,159
wire from New York.

37
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,540
Since I must leave tonight,

38
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,545
I will be forced to miss

39
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,964
Kathleen's...

40
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,302
memorial ceremony.

41
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,764
But you all know...

42
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,896
my thoughts

43
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,567
will be with her, in loving...

44
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,277
memory."

45
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,609
"Your loving son, John."

46
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,236
I'll pack the things he would have taken--

47
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,490
A suit, some shirts.

48
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,911
I'm finally rid of him.

49
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,624
I know I can handle his mother
without him around.

50
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,712
She's half-crazy anyway.

51
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,007
I can get rid of her,
one way or the other.

52
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,344
I'd better watch out
for his brothers, though...

53
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,931
especially the older one, Richard.

54
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,898
The typewriter. He wouldn't forget that.

55
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,902
He'd have to write letters on the plane.

56
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,698
I wonder if he'll rot underwater.

57
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,953
Everything, everything.

58
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,965
I'll make her change that ridiculous will.

59
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,941
"Your loving son, John."

60
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,693
Fat John.

61
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,975
I hope everything works out
with John's business.

62
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,645
I'm sure everything will be fine.

63
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,440
Your brother's always had a way
of solving his own problems.

64
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,401
Oh, I'm sorry. We're in your way.

65
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,947
What do you think of Ireland,
and Castle Haloran?

66
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,282
Ireland's fine.

67
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,119
Castle Haloran is a bit perplexing.

68
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:44,333
A very strange place, really,
old and musty,

69
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,920
the kind of place you'd expect a ghost
to like to wander around in,

70
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,839
kind of a haunted castle.

71
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,674
Castle Haloran is haunted.

72
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,801
By your mother?

73
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,262
By Kathleen.

74
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,849
I know very little about her.

75
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:06,355
In fact, I didn't even know you had
a sister until we arrived here.

76
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,440
There's not that much
to know about her, really.

77
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:14,029
My mother was about 40
when she gave birth to Kathleen.

78
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,700
It was like a gift, she used to say.

79
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,329
"An apple for the starving
and Kathleen for me."

80
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,249
She even had a poem.

81
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:32,214
"Three sons, each who would
marry and go away,

82
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:35,634
but little Kathleen would always stay."

83
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,848
It's engraven on her little tombstone now.

84
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,432
How did she die?

85
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,601
She drowned in the pond.

86
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,657
Passengers arriving from London and Cork,

87
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,328
Aer Lingus Irish International Airlines
wish you...

88
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,627
Your baggage will be delivered shortly
on the conveyor bell.

89
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,383
Passengers traveling onwards by air today

90
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,386
should check
at the passenger service desk.

91
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,639
Excuse me, miss.
Are-- Are you Kane?

92
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,100
- Yes. Hello.
- Well, I'm Billy, Richard's brother.

93
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,185
I came to get you.

94
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,438
- Oh, hi. I'm so happy to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

95
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,773
Richard's sorry
he couldn't come to get you, but he's--

96
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,902
Well, he's up to his elbows in statues,
so I said I wouldn't mind picking you up.

97
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,820
Thanks. That's awfully nice of you, Billy.

98
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,451
Aer Lingus Irish International Airlines
wish you...

99
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,499
Your baggage will be delivered
shortly on the conveyor belt.

100
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,755
My oldest brother, John,
had to leave early this morning,

101
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:56,215
but his wife, Louise, is still here.

102
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,133
She's from America,
So you won't get homesick.

103
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,218
That's my bag.

104
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,149
- Is it cold?
- Freezing.

105
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,526
But all old castles are like that.

106
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,987
To tell you the truth, Castle Haloran
gives me nightmares.

107
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,621
There it is.

108
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,814
Unbelievable.

109
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,530
We'll leave the luggage for a minute.
Come on, I'll take you to him.

110
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,245
This is where he works.

111
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,346
What is it?

112
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:28,390
I'm sorry, Richard.

113
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:32,644
Kane!

114
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,777
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

115
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,113
Well, I'm sorry I didn't pick you up
myself, honey,

116
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,740
but I wanted to finish this statue.

117
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,616
You look wonderful.

118
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,086
Well, I find
a statue reminds me of death.

119
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,297
How very unusual, Lady Haloran,

120
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,467
for a woman to have been married
to such a famous sculptor

121
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,552
and yet feel that way.

122
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:09,931
Did John mention
when he was going to return?

123
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,016
He wasn't sure.

124
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,229
We thought I'd stay on for a while
to get to know the family,

125
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,107
and then if he couldn't make it back,

126
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,776
I'd just return to New York.

127
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:24,529
How long is a little while?

128
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,448
As long as you like, Mother.

129
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,493
Well, you're very welcome here, Louise,

130
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:36,208
as long as you understand
the privacy of our personal duties.

131
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,960
I speak of the ceremony tomorrow.

132
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,296
I'm sure John explained it to you.

133
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,467
I'm afraid John was usually too busy
to talk much about the family.

134
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,554
That's why I'm so happy
to be here, finally.

135
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,765
You'll have a pleasant stay.

136
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:55,227
And I'm sure you can find something
to occupy your time during the ceremony.

137
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,104
It won't take very long.

138
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,816
Perhaps I am superstitious,

139
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,528
but I think it's important that only
the immediate members of the family

140
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:08,323
should give their thoughts to... Kathleen.

141
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,336
Excuse me.

142
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,183
Mother, I don't care what tragedy
hangs over this family.

143
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,476
I wanna get married.

144
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,229
I'm engaged to be married.
And I'm going to get married.

145
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,774
Moreover, I'm going to marry Kane.

146
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,700
Oh, Mother, Kathleen's dead.

147
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,743
She's been dead for seven years.

148
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,747
You never talked so much
when you were a child.

149
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,587
Well, I cried a lot, didn't I?

150
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,257
Afraid I might be doing that again
if you frighten her away from me.

151
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,763
You want me to include her,
to talk to her?

152
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:15,807
Yes.

153
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,395
Yes, I do.

154
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,856
Very well. I will.

155
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,526
I'll tell her I don't care for her.

156
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,697
Mother!

157
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:37,621
You hurt her and I promise you
I'll never forget it.

158
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,438
Thought you said
you didn't ride very much.

159
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,858
I don't. I'm just showing off,
'cause I finally got you to myself.

160
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,613
Good morning.

161
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,157
Oh, good morning, Louise.

162
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,077
It's nice to see her
enjoying herself for a change.

163
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,287
The mood around this place
isn't good for her.

164
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,706
Ah, she may be right.

165
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,292
Especially an American girl.

166
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,295
You can tell she's been
raised on promises.

167
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,464
What are you gonna do about that?

168
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,800
What are you going to do about that?

169
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,969
I don't understand.

170
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,180
I saw you squirming
when Mother read the will.

171
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,141
You gave John enough dirty looks
to give him a heart attack.

172
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,353
Don't joke about that.

173
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,273
You know he has a bad heart.

174
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,736
But I know you didn't mean anything by it.

175
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,615
You know, I think you ought to spend
more time with your wife-to-be.

176
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,784
You're an intelligent woman, Louise.

177
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,995
You notice things, size people up.

178
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,789
You know when they're happy
and know when something's bothering them.

179
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:06,710
- Want you to do me a little favor.
- Of course.

180
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:09,963
Keep that microscope you've got
built into your eye off of me.

181
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,090
I'll see you.

182
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,769
This will take you in, all right.

183
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,939
Oh, there's plenty of view from up there.

184
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:37,032
Must be very interesting to know
about all the secret passageways.

185
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:40,035
Oh, I know them all.
I've been here 20 years.

186
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,953
Twenty years? How wonderful.

187
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,663
Ah, well, you know how it is.

188
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,750
You get used to a family
and you get to like your room

189
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,585
and you get to know the run of the house.

190
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:51,671
And before you know it,
there you are, 20 years.

191
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,843
You must have been here, then,
when the little girl...

192
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:02,432
Ah, yes. That was a sad thing, that was.

193
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:05,644
Lord Haloran was a much-loved man,

194
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,647
and he invited one of the country fellows
up here for his wedding.

195
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,941
Oh, a big wedding that was,
a big banquet, and everyone invited.

196
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:16,196
She was all dressed up
as the bridesmaid,

197
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:19,157
running about to her heart's content
all over the place.

198
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,702
There's never been a wedding here since.

199
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,872
- What about Kane and Richard?
- Well, it's not my business,

200
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:29,042
but I wouldn't be betting
you'd see another wedding here.

201
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,752
Well, I must go back to work.

202
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:14,254
Billy? Billy? Billy, are you all right?

203
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:18,007
Oh, hello, Kane.
Oh, sure, sure, I'm fine.

204
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,218
I was just remembering about Kathleen.

205
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,553
Kathleen?

206
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,766
Oh, yes, the little girl.
Richard told me all about her.

207
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,685
We used to play together right here.

208
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,022
Sometimes I think I can still hear
her laughing, just like then.

209
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:37,569
- Is... Is this the pond where...
- Yes.

210
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,405
She was missing all night.

211
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:44,117
Mother was frantic, almost uncontrollable.

212
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,246
The next morning, we found Kathleen
floating in the water right over there.

213
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,832
I'm sorry, Billy.

214
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,668
No, Kane, I'm sorry.

215
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,258
I'm not always so morbid.

216
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,470
It's just that the funeral ceremony
is today.

217
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,930
It's a very beautiful pond.

218
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,976
You know, this is all just exactly
like I imagined Ireland would be.

219
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,313
It rained the day of the funeral.

220
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,857
We stood around her grave
under black umbrellas.

221
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:20,320
And then we threw flowers
under her little headstone.

222
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:23,239
Mother looked at the flowers...

223
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,867
and then she collapsed.

224
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,830
Every year it's been the same.

225
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,750
The umbrellas, flowers...

226
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,628
and mother's collapse.

227
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,715
But that was years ago.

228
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,676
Why do you keep having the same ceremony
over and over again?

229
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,640
There's some things
you don't understand, not yet.

230
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:28,239
Please, let me help.

231
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,414
Have Lillian prepare her room.
I'll take care of her.

232
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,797
What happened?

233
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,259
One of the flowers died
when it touched her grave.

234
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:18,581
Shh.

235
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:22,752
Rest.

236
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,427
There's something in this house...

237
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,682
like music in the hallways...

238
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:42,563
like a child's music,
asking me something...

239
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,275
but more like begging me.

240
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:49,237
Begging for what?

241
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,323
Begging for her mother to listen to her.

242
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,042
You know?

243
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,129
I've heard her.

244
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:09,257
She asks for you.

245
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,970
Poor tiny thing.

246
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:17,682
She wants you to listen to her.

247
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,271
- To watch for her signs.
- Oh, I do try.

248
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,608
Do you know what she wants?

249
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,362
She'll tell me. I promise you.

250
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,741
She'll tell me.

251
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,955
Now, rest. She'll give us a sign.

252
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:45,543
I promise you. Shh.

253
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,641
Are you lost?

254
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,728
No. Are you?

255
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:17,440
I think you'll find that you're in quite
the wrong part of Castle Haloran

256
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:18,733
to find your room.

257
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,111
Good night, Louise.

258
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,700
Good night.

259
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,322
Consider your mind as a bird in your hand.

260
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,867
When it's relaxed, it lies quiet and easy.

261
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,996
But when it's tense and frightened,

262
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,914
it strains to leave you.

263
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,340
Quite a simple principle, isn't it?

264
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:57,303
You're engaged to treat my body,
not my mind.

265
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,139
Now, don't you try to separate
that which nature has joined.

266
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:04,476
What I'm trying to say is this,
that every year at this time,

267
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,354
you work yourself
toward a point of hysteria.

268
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,817
You remember, you worry, you imagine,
and then you collapse.

269
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:17,156
I just can't believe that such a punctual
cycle is physiological.

270
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,035
And aside from all this, am I well?

271
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:23,245
Aside from all this?

272
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:25,289
Oh, yes.

273
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:30,336
What I want you to do is to rest
and to relax your mind.

274
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,256
Remember the bird in your hand.

275
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,762
Come in.

276
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,436
Will you bring a summer dress for madam,
something youthful and cheerful,

277
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,731
so that we can have lunch
on the terrace?

278
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:53,692
And my daughter-in-law, Louise?

279
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,943
She isn't in her room.

280
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,946
I don't think she slept there last night,
if you were to ask me.

281
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,240
Yeah, but nobody's asking you,
little girl.

282
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,827
Now, hurry up with the lunch, or I'll wish
five years of spinsterhood on you.

283
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,163
I must know where Louise is.

284
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:09,541
I've never noticed this interest
in your daughter-in-law before.

285
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,044
Will you please find her, Lillian?

286
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:15,798
- Yes, ma'am.
- Her ladyship's summer dress.

287
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,550
Anything will do.

288
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,185
Tell her I must see her.
Do you understand?

289
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,836
Excuse me, Mr. Haloran.

290
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,506
The mistress sent me to find
your sister-in-law, Louise.

291
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,049
Have you seen her, sir?

292
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,301
I'm sorry, Lillian. We left
pretty early this morning.

293
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,888
- She's not in her room?
- No, sir. Her room wasn't even slept in.

294
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,141
- Try asking my brother.
- Yes, sir.

295
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,017
Luncheon is served on the terrace.

296
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,936
- Thank you.
- I wonder where she is.

297
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:12,020
I don't know.

298
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,619
Ask me what I did today.

299
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,580
Right, what did you do today?

300
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:32,499
- Nothing. Ask me why.
- Why?

301
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,793
Because you weren't there.

302
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,253
I thought you were going to work.

303
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:37,921
If you're going to be my wife,

304
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,341
you'll have to be
of the trusting, silent variety.

305
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,180
- Hey, Richard, you seen Louise?
- No, I haven't. Why?

306
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,474
I don't know. Mother's looking for her.

307
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,935
- Oh, is that Caleb?
- He's back.

308
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:59,359
Good afternoon, Mother.
Good morning, Caleb.

309
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,571
- How are you, Richard?
- I'm fine, Caleb.

310
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,616
And no more headaches, I trust?

311
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:07,785
Unpleasant things, headaches,

312
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,579
gnawing away at a man's
most valuable possession.

313
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,041
And congratulations
on your charming fiancée.

314
00:38:16,418 --> 00:38:19,129
- Lillian.
- Patrick hasn't seen her, ma'am,

315
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:23,008
and Arthur says that none of the cars
except Master Billy's has been used.

316
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:24,843
Have you counted the silver?

317
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:28,555
Probably the most astute diagnose
you've ever made, Caleb.

318
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,350
You're all being ridiculous.

319
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,190
Kathleen?

320
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:09,972
The tiara. She wants the tiara.

321
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:13,684
Dolls?

322
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,186
Now, this is ridiculous.

323
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:24,194
Put it away. Probably belongs
to the gardener's child.

324
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:27,656
Now, this is very bad for your mother.

325
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,117
They're Kathleen's dolls.

326
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,619
I saw them float up
from the bottom of the pond.

327
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:38,041
One of you has a brilliantly imaginative
and sadistically effective mind.

328
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,209
I wish I could keep up with it.

329
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:43,380
Dr. Caleb, take this home and study it!

330
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,886
Fish the rest of them out. Burn them.

331
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,927
Are you gonna pound it all out
on that one little piece of metal?

332
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,429
I don't know.

333
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,891
You know, sometimes I get the feeling

334
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:38,894
you think I'm some sort
of a Christmas tree decoration.

335
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:41,521
Hang me up and look at me
on all the happy days,

336
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,942
and tie me up in a box and put me
in a closet when it gets gloomy.

337
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,693
You knew what I was like.

338
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,904
Oh, yes, I knew you were quiet,

339
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:52,574
but when we first met, I could sit
next to you in that little apartment,

340
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,619
watching you working
and thinking for hours.

341
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:57,537
It's this place. You know it is.

342
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,998
What do you want me to say?

343
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,502
- Nothing.
- Kane.

344
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,507
Believe me, I am sorry.

345
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,634
I don't care whether you're sorry or not.

346
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:15,847
Oh, Richard! Richard, I know
there are a lot of things

347
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,350
running around
in that beautiful head of yours.

348
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,686
I know that one of them is you love me.

349
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,062
Of course I love you.

350
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:25,857
But you must understand.

351
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,902
Ever since Kathleen died,

352
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,072
my mother's been running around
with some sort of crazy guilt,

353
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:34,324
looking to every one of us,

354
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,952
trying to put it on one of our heads.

355
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:40,038
Billy was only 13
two months after it happened.

356
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,540
He used to wake up
in the middle of the night

357
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:44,668
and come screaming into my room
because he had nightmares about her.

358
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:48,171
My own father died with his wife
refusing to see him.

359
00:41:50,048 --> 00:41:52,426
Now I feel it's been passed on to me.

360
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:56,680
I've got to wait, and I've got to watch,

361
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:58,890
till I can make some sense
out of all this.

362
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,855
That leaves it up to you to decide
whether you want to sit and wait with me.

363
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:31,381
What do you think of the pond, Arthur?

364
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,136
- I don't understand, sir.
- Of course not.

365
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,638
How long would it take you to drain it?

366
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,266
Well, I don't know, sir.
I've never drained it before

367
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:43,769
and I don't know
that I'd drain it properly.

368
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:47,439
There are three gear channel doors
on the pond.

369
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,524
Open them.

370
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:54,738
If I was you, I'd save that up
for a visit to my office.

371
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:57,532
You're losing weight. Skin's pale.

372
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,728
She always loved the tiara.

373
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,607
I wanted to put it in her coffin,
but they wouldn't let me.

374
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:36,947
I'll bring it to her playhouse
and put it with her other things.

375
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,874
The tiara.

376
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:34,462
You want the tiara.

377
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,124
Richard! Richard, please come!

378
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,335
Somebody, please come!

379
00:45:57,545 --> 00:45:59,381
Lillian, call the doctor.

380
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:02,092
- Will it be Dr. Caleb?
- Anybody.

381
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:03,677
And get Richard here.

382
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,853
Richard!

383
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,231
Hurry.

384
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:22,195
Still breathing.

385
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,584
Let's get her into the house.

386
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:15,999
Why don't you go to bed, Billy?

387
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,376
I will in a minute.

388
00:47:19,377 --> 00:47:22,297
You're gonna get all depressed
sitting here by yourself.

389
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,007
Did you ever see where my room is?

390
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:30,388
You have to go down a corridor where
nobody's lived for the past 50 years,

391
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,765
then up a flight of stairs

392
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:35,143
where my great grand uncle or somebody
tripped and broke his neck.

393
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:40,357
And then past the spot where
my grandfather died of a heart attack.

394
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,736
I'd rather be depressed here than there.

395
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,907
Poor Billy. No wonder you used
to get all those nightmares.

396
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,326
Used to? I still get them.

397
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:52,994
What are they like? Are they terrible?

398
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,830
I don't know.

399
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:59,751
They're more strange than terrible.

400
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:07,509
I'm always a little boy,
and I'm in my room. It's late.

401
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,680
I hear somebody outside making
a kind of a scraping sound.

402
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:18,269
I get out of bed, look out of the window,

403
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:24,234
and there's a man climbing up the wall,
coming closer toward my window.

404
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:26,945
I yell for my mother,
and she comes into the room,

405
00:48:27,028 --> 00:48:29,489
just as the man
is coming in through the window.

406
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:34,953
I hold on to her legs, crying.

407
00:48:35,036 --> 00:48:37,705
I'm so small I only come up to her waist.

408
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,751
The man is in the shadows.

409
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,379
You can almost recognize him,
but not really.

410
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:50,135
He says that he's insane

411
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:53,972
and that someone else
in the room is insane also

412
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:57,851
and that he's going to nod his head,
and when he does,

413
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,645
that other insane person
will nod their head.

414
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,567
He nods...

415
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:09,863
and I look up at my mother...

416
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,033
and she's nodding her head.

417
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,579
And then...

418
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,040
she starts laughing at me.

419
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,755
And she picks me up in her arms,

420
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,674
and runs outside and...

421
00:49:30,925 --> 00:49:32,510
throws me into the pond.

422
00:49:36,347 --> 00:49:38,975
Oh, Billy, we've all got
to get out of here.

423
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:42,520
Come on. Go to bed.

424
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,023
I'll walk you past
all those spooky corridors.

425
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:47,734
Hurry and get there before Richard
throws us both in the pond.

426
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,614
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

427
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,366
You just made me realize.

428
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,578
The man in my dream
who climbs up my wall is Richard.

429
00:50:00,121 --> 00:50:02,707
I'm sorry. I just never
thought of it before.

430
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,210
Just a dream.

431
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:22,352
- What is it, Arthur?
- Is Dr. Caleb in?

432
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:24,729
He's at breakfast. Is it important?

433
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:26,940
- Yes.
- All right, then.

434
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,609
Come on in.

435
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:42,121
Excuse me, but Arthur's here.

436
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,332
He says he has something
important to tell you.

437
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,711
Excuse me.

438
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:58,805
- Hello, Arthur.
- I drained the pond, like you told me to.

439
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,646
And there's something there
I think you'd want to see.

440
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:09,566
Show me.

441
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,947
Richard?

442
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,485
A shrine, beautifully done.

443
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,072
I never saw that before.

444
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,577
Why, it's skillfully carved,
I must say.

445
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,830
I work in iron, remember?

446
00:52:05,913 --> 00:52:08,291
Six years ago, you worked in stone.

447
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:09,542
I never did that.

448
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:15,465
Every one of us worked in stone.
My father loved teaching us.

449
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:18,343
Someone else did that. I didn't.

450
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,430
No one else pursued
this inherited talent. Nobody.

451
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:26,476
Leave him alone. He told you before
he's never seen it, and he meant it.

452
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,394
Come on, Richard, let's go.

453
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,354
No.

454
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,649
He's trying to play a game
with me, don't you see?

455
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,319
Your mother lies in bed in a state
of shock caused by something or somebody.

456
00:52:36,402 --> 00:52:38,029
I don't call that a game, Richard.

457
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:39,447
Has the all-seeing doctor noticed

458
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,660
that a certain money-hungry,
conniving little woman has left our midst?

459
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,119
That my mother, in her struggle,

460
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,706
clung on desperately
to a very valuable diamond tiara?

461
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,543
But I think that shrine has been
in that pond for five or six years.

462
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,504
I don't think that five or six years ago

463
00:52:54,587 --> 00:52:57,423
Louise had even heard
of Castle Haloran. Do you?

464
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,181
- What do you want out of this, Doctor?
- Oh, I don't know,

465
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:09,602
just a solution to the nightmare that has
disturbed this family for six years.

466
00:53:10,603 --> 00:53:13,940
After all, I am
the family doctor, you know.

467
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,866
I didn't mean to annoy your brother,
'cause I think he's right.

468
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,578
I think Louise did try to steal
your mother's tiara,

469
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,455
and I think she'll come back.

470
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,083
I think she's hiding somewhere in town.

471
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:33,751
Will you help me look for her?

472
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,379
- Sure, if you want me to.
- I do,

473
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:38,589
because your brother's upset,
and the young girl, too.

474
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,427
That leaves the two of us.
What do you think?

475
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,722
- Sure, I guess you're right.
- We'll look for her tonight.

476
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:58,437
- No!
- I told you not to follow me.

477
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,231
Look at you. You're frightened to death.

478
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:02,900
- Now, settle down.
- What are you doing here?

479
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:06,195
It's he studio where my father worked.
He kept his stone-cutting tools here.

480
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,240
I was trying to find out
who made that monument.

481
00:56:09,323 --> 00:56:12,243
Oh, Richard. Richard, I'm sorry.

482
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:14,620
I'll never doubt you again. I promise.

483
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:17,582
We can get married now.

484
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,001
Your mother's still sick
and she won't be able to stop us.

485
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,004
No one will be able to stop us.

486
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,563
Well, this is the devil's own climate.

487
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,773
Good for the grass
and the country doctors.

488
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,318
If I had to survive
by treating the common cold,

489
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,278
I might as well retire.

490
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:50,114
Two large Irish for Master Haloran.

491
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:51,866
Oh, no, no, I don't care for any.

492
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:54,076
Oh, just to take the chill
from your bones.

493
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,747
Drink's the only road
to survival in this climate.

494
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,875
Despite your useless American education,
you're still Irish, you know.

495
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,335
Drink up.

496
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,756
Do you know his sister-in-law,
John's wife, an American girl?

497
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:09,300
Fair hair, fair complexion?
You'd know her.

498
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:11,010
No, I have never seen her.

499
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:15,139
I've seen her at the chemist's, Doc,
about two or three days ago.

500
00:57:15,222 --> 00:57:16,724
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

501
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:20,394
Over here, Billy, nearer the heat.

502
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,111
Drink up.

503
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,533
What do you think, Billy?
Where did she go?

504
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,038
I don't know. Come on. Let's go.

505
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,332
Oh, there.

506
00:57:41,415 --> 00:57:45,503
You wouldn't begrudge an aging man
his moment's rest, would you?

507
00:57:47,588 --> 00:57:49,215
You know, I think you know the answer

508
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:52,510
to all the problems
your family's been having,

509
00:57:52,593 --> 00:57:56,806
because, Billy, you saw your little sister
drown all those years ago.

510
00:57:58,557 --> 00:58:00,893
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

511
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:04,355
You know how I know you did?

512
00:58:04,438 --> 00:58:06,399
- No.
- 'Cause you told me.

513
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,443
I did not.

514
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:13,197
Oh, Billy. Come on. Drink up.

515
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:20,287
Do you remember all those years ago,
when you couldn't sleep?

516
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:25,334
Do you remember who it was gave you
the little pill that made you sleep?

517
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:28,879
Remember the dreams,
faces in the shadows,

518
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,798
the man climbing up your wall?

519
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,426
I haven't forgotten.

520
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,430
Who was that man?

521
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:39,140
No. I don't know.

522
00:58:39,223 --> 00:58:42,309
Who was it that tried
to throw you in the pond?

523
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:46,105
Richard.

524
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:47,606
Tell me what happened.

525
00:58:48,649 --> 00:58:50,443
What happened to Louise?

526
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:56,323
Fishy, fishy in the brook

527
00:58:58,492 --> 00:59:03,164
Daddy caught you on a hook

528
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:09,336
Fishy, fishy in the brook

529
00:59:10,504 --> 00:59:16,010
Daddy caught you on a hook

530
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:23,601
Come on. Let's go.

531
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:31,067
- Has anyone here seen Richard?
- No, I haven't seen him.

532
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,457
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

533
01:00:18,614 --> 01:00:21,659
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

534
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:24,870
You know, the one thing in the world
that really chills my bones to the marrow

535
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,789
is when a pretty girl
in a wedding dress looks at me

536
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:29,500
- and finds me repulsive.
- Oh, don't be silly, Doctor.

537
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,710
Oh, I'm often silly,
one of my major vices.

538
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,463
Another one is the desire
on my part to help others,

539
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,340
however rancid that may sound.

540
01:00:36,423 --> 01:00:39,009
Then you can help me
by telling me where Richard is.

541
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:43,597
I'm not sure where Richard is
or, indeed what he is.

542
01:00:44,598 --> 01:00:47,685
Oh, and you wonder why young girls
in wedding dresses give you dirty looks.

543
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:51,647
No, no, no. I'm quite serious.

544
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,524
I've known this family
for a very long time.

545
01:00:53,607 --> 01:00:55,901
I've been aware
of the atmosphere of depression

546
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,029
and the slightly demented quality
that hangs over it.

547
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,116
But these are subtle matters,
so I never spoke.

548
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:06,537
I will tell you, young lady,
that I know that Louise did not leave,

549
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:10,291
but was... taken away from Castle Haloran.

550
01:01:10,374 --> 01:01:14,879
Perhaps even her husband, John,
didn't actually go on that business trip.

551
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,714
I don't know what you're talking about.

552
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:20,801
Because you don't know what I'm talking
about, you think I'm some kind of villain.

553
01:01:22,803 --> 01:01:24,889
Can you imagine what it's like
to try to help others

554
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:28,517
and to be mistrusted every time?
My lip twists.

555
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,312
This doesn't mean that
every word I say is sinister.

556
01:01:31,395 --> 01:01:32,938
I don't know what you're trying to say.

557
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,066
What I'm trying
to say to you is that I've...

558
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,737
discovered things in this house
that make me uneasy,

559
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,615
and that you are probably
in a position of some danger.

560
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:47,411
- From Richard?
- Primarily from Richard.

561
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:49,914
But I'm not sure. It could be anyone.

562
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,918
Well, maybe you have forgotten,
but I certainly haven't. I'm his wife now.

563
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,712
And there was a sister and a sister-in-law
and his mother...

564
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:59,465
and perhaps his eldest brother.

565
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:05,012
I swear to you, Dr. Caleb,
you are a very sick man.

566
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:09,892
Kane.

567
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:15,439
- What's the matter, honey?
- Where have you been?

568
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:16,941
I was just outside having a smoke.

569
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,818
Well, let's get out of here.
I don't want anyone to see me crying.

570
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:35,542
Come out, come out wherever you are

571
01:02:37,878 --> 01:02:41,590
These little nursery rhymes
are notoriously expressive.

572
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,321
Come on. I don't care
what anyone says about you.

573
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,156
Who said anything about me?

574
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,618
No one! Everyone! I don't care!

575
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,598
Little fishy in the brook...

576
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,233
Papa's hanged you on a hook.

577
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:01,003
Papa's caught you on the hook?

578
01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:08,737
What is it?

579
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,609
Don't touch her!

580
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:39,786
Forgive me, Kathleen.

581
01:06:45,792 --> 01:06:47,085
You children played with stone

582
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,796
the way other children played
with building bricks.

583
01:06:50,964 --> 01:06:54,801
They all forgot what a talented
little boy Billy was.

584
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,762
What about Kathleen?

585
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,391
He made a wax doll,

586
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:05,437
something he could protect,
to relieve his guilt.

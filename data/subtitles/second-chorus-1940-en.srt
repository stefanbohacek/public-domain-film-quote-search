1
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,035
The leader's Danny O'Neil.

2
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,389
Do you know him?

3
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,557
Oh, sure he's the best trumpet
player this college has ever had.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,556
Let's get closer.

5
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,033
I thought you'd like the music.

6
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,954
Great, wasn't it, Ellen?

7
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,033
Hi, Stu.
Where've you been?

8
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,036
Oh, I've been around.

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,197
Funny I was just saying the other day
I ought to see more of old Stu.

10
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,879
Well, er, we'd better go
and sit down or something Ellen.

11
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,035
See you later.

12
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,388
Your playing
was wonderful.

13
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,110
Thanks.

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,953
You don't think she
meant you, do you?

15
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,399
You don't think
she meant you, do you?

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,956
Wait a minute.

17
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,629
You don't think she'd fall for that
station house music of yours?

18
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,036
It's not so much
my music, it's my personality.

19
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,877
I'll show you.

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,397
Hello Stu.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,116
Oh, Mr. O'Neill,
won't you join us?

22
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,477
Oh, thank you.
See you later son.

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,112
Well Stu.
Do you want something?

24
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,752
Me? Oh, no, no.

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,229
I've been wanting
to meet you for some time Mr. O'Neil.

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,955
That's wonderful!
You mean you like the band?

27
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,039
Oh I didn't mean I wanted
to meet the band exactly,

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,436
although I thought
they did back you up rather well.

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,879
Thanks. Is there any special
number you'd like to hear?

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,829
I would like to hear the
Call-Me-Up-and-Call-me-down blues.

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,237
The what?

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,834
The Call-Me-Up-
and-Call-Me-Down blues.

33
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,156
I know what you mean.
I'm afraid I haven't got the number.

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,637
Oh, I'm sure you'll be
able to get hold of it.

35
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,835
Why don't you go back
to the bandstand and look for it?

36
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,269
No hurry Stu.

37
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,269
It's such a long time since we got
together. I want to make the most of it.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,358
It's heartwarming
that's what it is.

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,196
Nothing like old college friends,
I always say.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,037
All for one
and all for one. Ha, Ha.

41
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,594
Yes sir, I think I'd better
be getting back. So long Stu.

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,636
So long.

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,239
Alright let's play
number nine.

44
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,954
Why can't you
go on a picnic?

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,838
Mr. Dunn is inside,
Mr. Taylor.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,230
Mr. Dunn?
He wouldn't be any fun on a picnic.

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,675
This is a collection agency.
Not an escort bureau.

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,193
Now will you please
get of my desk?

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,634
Is this fellow annoying you
Miss Miller?

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,513
- Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,996
I was just seeing Miss Miller here
about the encyclopedias.

52
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,277
I figure
I can take care of the details.

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,431
As Miss Miller was kind enough
to serve me with the summons,

54
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,755
I'll explain the details.

55
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,915
What is there to explain?

56
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,996
Seven years ago,
you bought a set of encyclopedias

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,109
for which you've never paid.

58
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,196
But I didn't buy them.

59
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,509
Please,
you're wasting my time.

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,352
See,
you're wasting Miss Miller's time.

61
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,594
As I was saying seven years ago,
I must have broken a mirror

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,716
because that walked in
and became my roommate.

63
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,037
I was only a simple
freshman at the time.

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,278
What are you now?
A simple sophomore?

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,679
Oh, Miss Miller
you're being a bit unkind.

66
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,956
After all, we've worked hard
to stay in college this long.

67
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,148
It's not easy for a couple of bright guys
like us to go on flunking year after year.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,558
What in the world
are you talking about?

69
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,397
Well, it's like this.

70
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,957
As long as we can stay in college,
the band makes us a comfortable living.

71
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,633
That's right five,
six thousand dollars a year.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,518
That's more than
you can make on Wall Street.

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,712
Besides, it's a nice life.
Cultural, relaxing, gay.

74
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,399
Getting back
to the subject.

75
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,479
This roommate whom I trusted ordered
a set of encyclopedias in my name.

76
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,635
That's gratitude.

77
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,996
It was a birthday present.
You were crazy about them.

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,952
I was crazy about them
till I got the bill.

79
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,630
Miss Miller.

80
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,910
What's this?

81
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,469
Mr. O'Neill,
Mr. Taylor, Mr. Dunn.

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,199
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes! Step right in.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,513
Now look Mr. Dunn.
Here's the situation:

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,829
we're temporarily embarrassed.

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,190
You see we're working
our way through college.

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,353
You've been working your way
through college for the last seven years.

87
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,555
Well, takes time.

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,789
Specially when you're struggling.

89
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,111
Boys you don't pull any wool over me.
You ain't broke, you ain't struggling.

90
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,389
You mean you
doubt our word?

91
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,397
You said it. I've got your number.
You're businessmen.

92
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,591
Now pay up or go to jail.
That's final!

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,990
Final, Eh?

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,871
Final.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,876
Final!

96
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,997
Well, maybe we ought to ask
for an extension, hit it.

97
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,711
Ok. Dunnsy boy we do make money.

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,518
We haven't got any
right now just give us one month.

99
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,478
- Just one month's extension.
- OK Dunnsy.

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,271
I won't listen.

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,709
I'll be around in a -

102
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,750
- What do you think we are?
- Fly-by-nights?

103
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,313
My word is
good enough, isn't it?

104
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,917
Everybody in town can-

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
Have that money here tomorrow
or I'll see you in court.

106
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,111
No!

107
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,990
No.

108
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,833
That's a sordid little fella, isn't he?
Sordid little place.

109
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,756
Must be a sordid
life for such a lovely girl.

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,559
Oh, there's nothing
so sordid about it.

111
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,519
Except the people
we deal with.

112
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,672
It's a pity we can't
take Miss Miller out of this.

113
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,995
Yes.
How'd you like some fresh air?

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,391
Sorry, I have work to do.

115
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,829
She's very businesslike,
isn't she?

116
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,517
Yes.

117
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,714
I like that in a secretary.

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,598
In fact, I'd like to have
a secretary like that.

119
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,991
You know, there's an
awful lot of work running a band.

120
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,270
Come to think of it,
we do need a secretary.

121
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,109
But I don't need a job.

122
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,708
So she doesn't
need a job.

123
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,750
Whatever it is I won't do it.
Now, I want to tell you.

124
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,232
Ssh!

125
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,076
Now look Mr. Dunn
I want to do the right thing.

126
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,191
We don't care anything about
the encyclopedia company.

127
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,515
No, we care
about you.

128
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,673
Oh yeah - er, well maybe
I said a few hasty words, boys.

129
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,030
Let bygones
be bygones, eh?

130
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,514
Two dollars?
But the bill's a hundred and ten.

131
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,193
That's for you
to fix things up.

132
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,275
What are you
talking about?

133
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,159
Are you asking me
to take a bribe?

134
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,995
A two dollar bribe?

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,959
Oh, come on, Dunn. We're all
men of the world, you know.

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,513
We'll keep it under our hats.
Don't worry about it.

137
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,432
Sure, you can depend on us.
She'll tell you.

138
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,390
She? Who?

139
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,795
Miss Miller.

140
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,432
Miss Miller.

141
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,472
Miss Miller!
Come in here please.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,594
Did you intimate to these men
that I could be bribed?

143
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,756
She didn't say your could be bribed,
she said you could be fixed.

144
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,837
Well Mr. Dunn,
I didn't say any such thing.

145
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,030
Oh get her.

146
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,593
Oh yes you did,
she didn't want us to tell you.

147
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,671
Don't believe him
Mr. Dunn,

148
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,438
I heard her myself.
Didn't you hear her?

149
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,516
Wait a minute!

150
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,076
I'll have you deadbeats
put in jail,

151
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,077
and as for you Miss Miller
you're fired!

152
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,277
Oh!

153
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,948
Thanks a lot
old man.

154
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,790
Thanks old boy.

155
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,074
Miss Miller,
Miss Miller,

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,955
wait a minute!

157
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,111
Haven't you rover boys
caused enough trouble already?

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,395
It was really
a kindly gesture.

159
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,676
A very kindly gesture.
Now I haven't even a reference.

160
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,630
But I don't demand
a reference.

161
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,630
We know you
for what you are.

162
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,232
Yes.

163
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,033
You mean you
really want me to work for you?

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,155
Sure,
Wouldn't you like it?

165
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,957
What's your salary?

166
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,552
Eighteen a week.

167
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,470
He'll double it.

168
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,999
Yeah - er - Yeah!

169
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,111
Well.

170
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,198
Hit it.

171
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,112
Let me tell you,
here's the chance of a lifetime:

172
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,276
we’re going all the way to the
- You can't go wrong if...

173
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,398
Alright I'll take it.

174
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,032
Good.

175
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,797
When do I start?

176
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,716
Right now.

177
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,829
Well now that I'm
working for you,

178
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,836
I'll tell you something.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,036
Dunn can be bought
but his price isn't two dollars,

180
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,956
It's ten!

181
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,269
Here you want
to take care of the details

182
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,191
Hey!

183
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,754
Well, here we are.

184
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,358
You can have half of that desk, a quarter
of that rack and just - go to work.

185
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,478
There's only one detail
that you've omitted.

186
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,476
What are my duties?

187
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,195
- Oh, you type a little.
- Telephone a little.

188
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,595
Keep the leader happy.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,319
Keep your eye
on the brass section.

190
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,874
I thought you said
this was a job.

191
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,191
Lining up good
engagements is no cinch.

192
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,829
What's so difficult about it?

193
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,071
Operator get me
The Riverdale Country Club.

194
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,674
Oh no, we've already tried.

195
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,359
Who's in charge there?

196
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,710
Mr. Bent, isn't it?

197
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,149
Bent real sourpuss.

198
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,589
Hello Mr. Bent?

199
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,838
This is Mr. O'Neill 's
Secretary

200
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,630
No Danny O'Neill,
the orchestra leader.

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,389
I read in the paper that
you're planning a Halloween dance...

202
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,512
Hob Harvey's
Cornell Clippers oh,

203
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,119
but we entertain too

204
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,832
Do we entertain?

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,796
No but we can
dream up something.

206
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,520
Oh but our entertainment's terrific.
That's our strongpoint.

207
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,912
Mr. Benn until you've seen
the Perennials you haven't lived.

208
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,918
It isn't
that I don't admire Emil Colman,

209
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,951
but isn't his music...
shall we say rowdy?

210
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:52,078
Now, Mr. O'Neill 's salon ensemble
play everything gently but with a lilt.

211
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,272
And all his boys
are from such nice families.

212
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,876
Very well, we'll expect
them at seven-thirty.

213
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,111
Thank you.

214
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,391
Believe me, bud, my outfit are killers.
Just what you need for one-nighters.

215
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,071
- Can they pack 'em in like Dorsey?
- Solid Jack!

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,510
Murder!

217
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,115
Furthermore, I could come
down the day before the dance

218
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,514
and help you with
the decorations.

219
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,273
That is, of course,
if you want me to.

220
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,631
Wait a minute men,
we took a poll on the campus

221
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,756
and almost everybody
voted for Artie Shaw's band.

222
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,872
Artie Shaw?
Who's Artie Shaw?

223
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,794
You were terrific, Chief.

224
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,672
Yeah, yeah -
glass of water please.

225
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,791
What about that prom,
is it set?

226
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,676
Not exactly, chief.

227
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,235
- They hired that college band.
- Danny O'Neill's Perennials.

228
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,436
O'Neill again, Huh?

229
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,313
This is the fourth time
we've run into them on college dates.

230
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,831
Either they've got a
great band or a fine manager.

231
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,431
I gotta go up
and hear them sometime.

232
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,470
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about them.

233
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,033
They'll be graduating
in another week.

234
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,639
Hmm!
Not The Perennials.

235
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,309
OK, boys. No graduation this year.
I flunked three courses.

236
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,557
Alright, boys,
break it up break it up.

237
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,548
Oh, Danny you're wonderful.

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,911
Well Danny old boy,
we made it again, Huh?

239
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,632
Er...

240
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,797
What's the matter?

241
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,633
Well Hank,
I don't quite know how to tell you.

242
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,355
What do you mean
I passed?

243
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,398
Oh, I couldn't graduate -
not with my marks.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,716
What are you kiddin' me?

245
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,196
Oh, listen there must
be some mistake.

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,792
I'm not gonna
take this lyin' down.

247
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,629
I'm gonna see
the Dean about it.

248
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,949
They can't do this to me.

249
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,035
Oh, Danny.

250
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,833
Poor old Hank
he got careless.

251
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,992
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you?

252
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,790
Why Ellen!

253
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,269
Of course - a little peace and quiet
won't hurt either of us.

254
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,829
But poor Hank.

255
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,836
You still have me.

256
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,712
I guess we'll have to carry on as good
old Hank would have wanted us to.

257
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,479
It seems to me.

258
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,029
It seems to you?

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,599
I said it seems to me.

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,558
You said it seems to you.

261
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,950
It seems to me
I smell a mouse.

262
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,037
Somewhere about the house.

263
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,112
It seems to me.

264
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,350
It seems to you.

265
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,515
I said it seems to me.

266
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,829
You said it seems to you.

267
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,312
That such embarrassing situation
calls for concentration.

268
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,430
Do you dig me Jack?

269
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,994
We dig you Jack.

270
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,196
Can you think of a plan?

271
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,429
We solid can.

272
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,629
To get me out
of this mess?

273
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,154
Er- yes, yes, yes.

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,515
We'll start the music
and play it back.

275
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,110
Solid, Jack.

276
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,230
Solid Jack.

277
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,150
- Can ya sing and dance?
- I'll take a chance.

278
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,828
- Are your boots on right?
- I got 'em laced up tight.

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,389
- Is Miss Miller a killer?
- From Spanish villa.

280
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,068
- Is her dancin' mellow?
- Why mello as a cello.

281
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,959
Then it seems to me ob-vious-ly.

282
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,350
Why not go right
into your terpischore?

283
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,670
What will it be?

284
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,110
Don't look at me.

285
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,713
Now, let me see
what will it be?

286
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,752
I never could do
the Conga

287
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,832
Could never get
thru' the Conga.

288
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,271
But if you say
'do the Conga'

289
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,954
I ain't hep to that step.
but I'll dig it.

290
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,157
I never could
see Mazurkas

291
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,197
There poison to me
Mazurkas

292
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,438
But if it's to be
Mazurkas

293
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,440
I ain’t hep to that step
but I'll dig it

294
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,877
When they invented
the Charleston

295
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,314
He was a total flop.

296
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,479
Right! But say -
if you want to Charleston

297
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,636
I'll never stop
or dance till I drop.

298
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,678
I never could
dig the polka.

299
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,958
The corniest jig,
the polka.

300
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,511
But if you say
dig the polka.

301
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,036
I ain't hep to
that step but I'll dig it.

302
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,951
Hi Hank.

303
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,236
Hello there.

304
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,709
Did you get anywhere
with the Dean?

305
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,629
No, it seems that the article I wrote
on the decline of the harpsichord

306
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,031
and her sister instruments
is what really put me across.

307
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,631
Is that so?

308
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,792
Yeah, funny I don't even
remember writing that article.

309
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,918
Yet the Dean said it was so good, he
couldn't possibly think of flunking me.

310
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,397
Tough luck.

311
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,192
Yeah.

312
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,953
Cheer up boy it's probably
all for the best.

313
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,590
What have you
got there?

314
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,036

315
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,870
Think of it Hank.

316
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,276
You'll go into your father's textile
business, a cog in a great industry.

317
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,315
Stamping you personality
on miles and miles of tweed

318
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,468
making the wheels turn.

319
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,552
Punching the clock -
listening to the song of the looms -

320
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,828
what volume is that?

321
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,072
It's... Ham to Ilk.
Why?

322
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,909
Oh, nothing.
Music wasn't for you, Hank.

323
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,429
You could never have got anywhere
with that beat-up trumpet of yours.

324
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,759
Your medium is textiles.

325
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,798
Your father was a textile man -
so was his father before him.

326
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,469
Why, you've got wool
in your blood Hank.

327
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,113
What's the bookmark for?

328
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,835
Oh, it's an article there -
rather interested the Dean.

329
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,757
You know, funny thing
about that article.

330
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,558
It's almost identical
with my thesis.

331
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,635
Interesting coincidence.

332
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,199
Yes, that's what
the Dean thought.

333
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,193
I had quite a time persuading him
that the marginal notes weren't mine.

334
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,709
As a matter of fact, I tried to convince
him that the handwriting wasn't yours.

335
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,951
Yeah?

336
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,718
Yeah.

337
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,750
What did he say?

338
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,509
He said you were fired.

339
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,557
You dog!

340
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,636
Now, take it easy,
Danny.

341
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,233
You low,
conniving dog!

342
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,072
You too will have
to face the world.

343
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,759
Fall right into your
father's concrete.

344
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,188
You'll be a cog
within a cog.

345
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,952
You can't get away
from it, Danny my boy.

346
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,519
You've got concrete
in your bones.

347
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,229
Danny, hey! Hurry!
Wonderful news!

348
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,995
A telegram!

349
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,513
"Will be in town Saturday. Would like
to look over your outfit." Artie Shaw.

350
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,789
Well, what do you know?

351
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,599
Hey, well there it is.
Shaw wants to look me over.

352
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,193
Look you over?
Look us over.

353
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,591
Alright, us. Hmm, seems to be
in a kind of a rush about it.

354
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,479
I wonder how soon
he wants me to start.

355
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,511
Hey, it didn't take him long
to find out I'd be available, did it?

356
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,273
You'll be available indefinitely,
I'm afraid.

357
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,036
Yeah. Now then, first thing tomorrow,
I must find Ellen a new job.

358
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,714
Don't bother.
As soon as I get set, I'll send for you.

359
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,149
Oh, that's very kind of you.

360
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,634
Alright. Let's get organized.

361
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,836
Call the boys and tell them
to be there early. Summer uniforms.

362
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,958
And you - you go home
and run your scales. Come on!

363
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,816
Look, fella. Don't bury it.
I'll be out in a few minutes.

364
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,615
Artie Shaw!

365
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,655
Artie Shaw, he's here!

366
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,616
Good, thanks.

367
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,852
Hey, what about
the buck you promised me?

368
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,178
Alright, alright beat it.

369
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,937
OK, gang. Sweet Sue.

370
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,850
Hank!
Shaw, he's coming in now!

371
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,617
Swell. Thanks, pal.

372
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,010
Come on, give out.

373
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,375
I'll bring you
some change.

374
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,371
Now, a nice and easy background
on this one, boys.

375
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,413
Hey, Danny.
Why don't you lay out on this one?

376
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,093
Save your lip till Shaw comes.
I'll take the lead.

377
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,010
Are you kiddin'?

378
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,499
I'm OK, I've been
in the woodshed.

379
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,176
You've been in the cornfield.
Alright, boys. One-two.

380
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,650
Say, that's quite a little
shindig you're pitchin' in there.

381
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,374
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Shaw.

382
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,893
Band on straight
salary or percentage?

383
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,016
Oh, percentage.

384
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,977
Oh smart, uh!

385
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,415
Thanks again, Mr. Shaw.

386
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,496
Where's Mr. Miller?

387
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,496
Mr. Miller?

388
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,655
Yeah,
the manager of the band.

389
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,497
Oh, that Mr. Miller...
There she is.

390
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,490
This is Mr. Shaw, Mr. Miller -
I mean, er...

391
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,890
We've been expecting you,
Mr. Shaw.

392
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,052
Swell. If you're not too busy, I'd like
to talk to you for a few minutes.

393
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,011
Fine.

394
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,579
Won't you stay
and hear the band, Mr. Shaw?

395
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,175
I'd like to but I'm on my way
down to Trenton to play a date.

396
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,768
Anyway, it was nice
talking to you.

397
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,373
- Thanks and goodnight.
- Goodnight.

398
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,010
Thanks.

399
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,095
No trouble.

400
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,335
Where is he?

401
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,330
He's gone.

402
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,057
Gone?

403
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,136
- Where's Shaw? What did he say?
- He's gone. You ruined it.

404
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,417
What are you talkin' about?
I was terrific. When do I start?

405
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,376
Oh, take ten, son.

406
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,975
What was his proposition?

407
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,290
Well, his proposition
rather surprised me.

408
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,257
Oh!

409
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,210
Quibbled about salary?

410
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,699
Wait a minute,
I don't work on Sundays.

411
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,016
Look, Ellen,
what gives? When do I start?

412
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,331
You don't.

413
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,452
What?
Well, then what did he want?

414
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,093
Me.

415
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,329
- Ellen!
- Oh, Danny!

416
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,535
I brought you this!

417
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,736
Oh, I guess I'm a little late.

418
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,336
Oh, Danny. How darling of you.
Hank's inside getting a ticket.

419
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,330
Is he?

420
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,811
Gosh, Ellen,
I hate to see you go.

421
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,138
Oh, I hate to go,
Danny.

422
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,171
I - I kinda
hoped that...

423
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,250
What Danny?

424
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,339
Oh, nothing. I guess
it was just silly, that's all.

425
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,859
No, it wasn't.
What was it?

426
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,011
Excuse me.
You're sprouting.

427
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,979
Here's some popcorn. Sonny, hold this
for the lady. Here's your ticket, Ellen.

428
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,655
Come on, I'll tell the conductor
when to let you off.

429
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,254
Now, be a good girl
and don't talk to any strange men.

430
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,734
I won't.
I'll see you in New York?

431
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,089
- I hope so.
- Yes.

432
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,974
Well, I don't know.
Portland's a long way from New York

433
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,778
and concrete
kinda holds a man down.

434
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,251
Well,
you'll be there, Hank?

435
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,688
No. I've gotta pay a lot of attention
to those mills in Fall River.

436
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,290
Well, I won't be seeing
either of you?

437
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,131
No.

438
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,056
Well, I'm afraid not.

439
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,939
All aboard!

440
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,610
- Well, goodbye, you idiots.
- Goodbye. Look after her orchids.

441
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,489
Goodbye!

442
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,496
Bye!

443
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,656
- When do you start for Portland?
- Tonight.

444
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,378
- When do you leave for Fall River?
- Oh, about an hour.

445
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,769
I'll see you off.

446
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,453
No, don't bother.
You've got to pack.

447
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,859
Yeah. Well, this is it.

448
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,533
Right. So long, Danny.

449
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,972
- So long, kid. It's been a lot of fun.
- You bet it has. Take care of yourself.

450
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,249
- I'll drop you a line.
- Do that.

451
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,578
A college band?
Whoever heard of a good college band?

452
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,810
Oh, we were under the impression
that this was an important affair.

453
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,855
Oh, it is.

454
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,215
Oh well in that case,
I know you'll want Mr. Shaw.

455
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,733
That's fine. Thank you.

456
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,769
A couple of relatives.

457
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,089
Well, what's cookin', Ellen?

458
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,376
We close the Atlantic City job
on our own terms.

459
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,570
That's swell.

460
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,049
And the intercollegiate prom.

461
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,890
Not a bad two day's work. Looks like
my hunch about you was pretty good.

462
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,769
I'm glad. Mr. Shaw, I...
I wonder if I could ask you a favor.

463
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,651
Of course.

464
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,697
It's - it's about
a couple of trumpet players.

465
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,378
Oh, well, you see I always pick
my own men, Ellen and I don't...

466
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,571
Of course, but all I want you to do
is hear these boys.

467
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,856
- They're marvelous.
- Where are they? Around town?

468
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,976
Practically. One's in Portland
and the other's in Fall River.

469
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,170
But they could be here in a jiffy.

470
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,739
Isn't that a lot
of travelin' just for an audition?

471
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,970
But they wouldn't mind. And once you
hear them, you'll know what I mean.

472
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,092
If you think they're that good,
I'll listen to them.

473
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,694
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

474
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,454
Call the Western Union boy to pick up
two telegrams. Thank you.

475
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,538
- What floor is Artie Shaw on?
- Seventeenth.

476
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,377
Going up.

477
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,411
Hold it, buddy.

478
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,529
- What floor is Artie Shaw on?
- Seventeenth.

479
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,489
Aren't you going
to Fall River the hard way?

480
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,572
I suppose this elevator
stops at Portland.

481
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,811
No, sir.
Last stop is the 22nd floor.

482
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,015
So you were going
to give a lot of time to the mills.

483
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,608
Listen, I've got as much right
here as you have.

484
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,375
Why don't you face facts, Hank?
Ellen's not even established yet.

485
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,853
She can't possibly
get us both in the band.

486
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,174
I'm going to get
a try-out with Artie Shaw

487
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,331
if I have to tear down
this building floor by floor.

488
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,859
17th floor next.

489
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,733
Here's a present
for you, Sam.

490
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,135
Have one on me, Sam.

491
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,174
Oh, excuse me.

492
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,490
- Where's Artie Shaw's office, please?
- Right that way.

493
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,297
Oh, thanks.

494
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,333
Mr... Mr. Taylor to see Miss Miller.

495
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,654
Miss Miller's very busy
right now.

496
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,732
She'll see me,
we went to college together.

497
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,574
Hey, is that 34 or 54
Highcroft Road?

498
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,737
34. Hey, wait a minute.
What have you got there?

499
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,496
Why, this is for me!

500
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,410
Yeah.

501
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,813
Hank, Shaw's
sending for me.

502
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,374
Me too. You know, I knew he'd
get around to that sooner or later.

503
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,615
Any answers?

504
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,691
We'll take care of the answers, bud.
Here.

505
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,690
Thanks.

506
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,532
It's alright.

507
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,015
- What do you make of this?
- Look at that, Fall River.

508
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,131
Say! Excuse me...

509
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,248
Something phony about this.

510
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,130
Yeah.

511
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,978
He walked out on us
at the Prom, didn't he?

512
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,850
Yeah.

513
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,376
- You don't suppose it was deliberate?
- Why would he?

514
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,612
You mean he'd want us to cool
for a while so we'd work for peanuts.

515
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,259
Listen, we're not that hard
to get.

516
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,297
No. But then he got Ellen
down here as a decoy,

517
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,092
thinking we'd work for nothing
on account of her.

518
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,216
That's it.
How do ya like it?

519
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,416
I don't like it.
He can't treat a friend of ours like that.

520
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,410
No, sir!

521
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,534
I'll fix him. Just for that, I'm gonna
ask for 25 dollars a week more.

522
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,496
Fifty!

523
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,931
Young lady, you can tell Shaw
that we'll see him.

524
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,010
Mr. Shaw is very busy.

525
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,693
Never mind, we'll tell him.
Thanks. Come on, Hank.

526
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,175
Hey, wait a minute.

527
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,497
Hi, Shaw.

528
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,537
Now, just a minute, fellas.
You'll have to wait outside.

529
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,213
I'm the new trumpet player
you just sent for.

530
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,098
And me too.
We've just got your wire.

531
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,809
What the?

532
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,568
Oh, yeah-well, you certainly
took your time getting here.

533
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,497
Well, we had a couple
of other offers to consider.

534
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,292
Alright, boys,
I tell you what you do.

535
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,576
Drop down to the hotel tonight and
play a couple of tunes for the band.

536
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,334
- That'll be swell.
- Love to.

537
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,412
See you then,
I'm sorry, I'm pretty busy now.

538
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,610
Well, that's alright.
Which is Miss Miler's office?

539
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,730
Right across the hall.

540
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,569
Oh, thanks. Think I'll have
a little talk with her.

541
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,813
OK, Artie -
ha, ha, ha.

542
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,410
Ellen!

543
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,653
Danny! I can't believe
my eyes.

544
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,691
It's so good
to see you.

545
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,688
Kinda surprised you,
huh?

546
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,094
Kinda surprised you,
huh?

547
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,778
And Hank,
wherever did you come from?

548
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,770
Artie Shaw's office.

549
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,850
We were just talking
a little business.

550
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,216
But Portland?

551
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,854
Portland's loss
is your gain.

552
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,850
And Fall River?

553
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,208
Fall River will have
to suffer too.

554
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,099
Did Artie say anything
about giving you a try-out?

555
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,010
Oh, sure.

556
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,659
Oh, darlings,
that's wonderful!

557
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,339
Yes, but we haven't
promised him anything yet.

558
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,570
Straight ahead.

559
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,329
Hey, there!

560
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,216
Good evening, Cap.

561
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,213
I'm the new trumpet
player with Artie Shaw.

562
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,688
I ain't never seen
you before.

563
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,051
It's alright, you're going
to see plenty of me from now on.

564
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,613
Oh, by the way. If my brother
happens to drop around here tonight,

565
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,374
tell him that Shaw's not giving
any more auditions, see.

566
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,055
If he makes a fuss,
just throw him out.

567
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,852
You know how these little
family jealousies are. Thanks.

568
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,095
What's your name?

569
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,299
Danny O...
O' Taylor.

570
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,017
Danny, I'm so glad
you got here early.

571
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,614
I was lonesome. I haven't seen you
since late this afternoon.

572
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,293
Not a bad house.
How long are we booked here for?

573
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,259
You're only booked
for one number.

574
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,889
This audition?
Mere formality.

575
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,931
Where's Hank?

576
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,697
Hank?

577
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,295
How do I know?
Am I my brother's keeper?

578
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,899
I thought he was coming
with you.

579
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,254
He probably got
cold feet.

580
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,496
Couldn't face the humiliation
of being turned down.

581
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,376
Poor boy, I wish I could
do something to help him.

582
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,970
Oh, yes.

583
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,010
Ah, now, Ellen.
I'm very fond of Hank.

584
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,693
After all, he did bring
us together.

585
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,499
If it hadn't been
for those encyclopedias

586
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,888
I might never have met you.

587
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,017
I'll always be grateful
to him for that.

588
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,329
Won't you?

589
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,336
- Danny, this is no time.
- Yes, it is. This is just the time.

590
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,975
Yesterday, what was I?
A carefree schoolboy.

591
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,660
Today what?
A man with his career assured,

592
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,811
a man with plans
for the future.

593
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,856
Danny, don't you think
you ought to be warming up?

594
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,891
I've been warmed up
a long time.

595
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,730
Ellen...

596
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,697
Shall I take
the vocal?

597
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,935
Would you like to be
the love of my life

598
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,735
for always.

599
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:44,373
And always watch over me.

600
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,894
To square my blunders
and share my dreams.

601
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,734
One day with caviar.

602
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,739
Next day a chocolate bar.

603
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,050
Would you like
to take the merry-go-round,

604
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,209
I'll lead you

605
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,091
I need you - just wait
till you see.

606
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,097
I hope in your horoscope

607
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,054
There is room
for a dope who adores you.

608
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,530
That would make the only
dream of my life...

609
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,619
come true.

610
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,412
For the love
of my life...

611
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,414
is you.

612
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,730
Ellen.

613
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,733
So, I'm your brother,
huh?

614
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,299
I was afraid you
wouldn't make it.

615
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,490
You shouldn't worry about me,
brother Danny.

616
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,695
Ellen, I think
you'd better leave.

617
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,855
No, no, stick around.

618
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,770
What happened, Hank?

619
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,697
Brother Danny here
framed me with the doorman.

620
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,498
All I wanted was to be
alone with you for once.

621
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,013
See that?
He admits the whole thing.

622
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,256
- Oh, now wait a minute.
- That doorman hit me in the lip.

623
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,176
- He did?
- Yeah.

624
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,972
- Oh, that's too bad.
- How'd you like to even it up, huh?

625
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,017
Oh no, boys, please.
You have to go on in a minute.

626
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,653
You're putting me
in an awful position.

627
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,017
Now, come on, let's forget it. I'll tell
Artie you're here. Good luck, darlings.

628
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,290
Yeah, darlings.

629
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,218
You haven't forgotten
the two trumpet players?

630
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,329
No, I'll be right with you.

631
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,012
Quick, let's go.

632
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,658
I'll put your boys on, but first give me
a hand with that character over there.

633
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,215
He's been here ten nights in a row.
He's an awful ear bend.

634
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,609
Well, well.

635
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,179
Mr. Chisholm,
this is Miss Miller.

636
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,136
How do you do,
Miss Miller?

637
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,256
Well, sir, did that last number
jump for you?

638
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,172
Oh, very peppy.
Very peppy indeed.

639
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,973
By the way,
what chord did we finish on?

640
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,490
Er, B flat.

641
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,299
Shaw, I missed it again.

642
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,569
Won't you two join me?

643
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,497
I'm sorry, I've got to get back
and play the next number.

644
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,178
But Miss Miller
can tell you all about the band.

645
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,298
- Is Miss Miller hep as you boys say?
- Hep as they come.

646
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,492
Fascinating, swing jargon.
I'm becoming hep to it myself.

647
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,089
- Well, see you later, Mr. Chisholm.
- So long, gate.

648
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,333
That's short for alligator.
Please be seated.

649
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,133
Are you a musician,
Mr. Chisholm?

650
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,450
Oh, I should have been
but I was forced to give it up.

651
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,489
I said music and father said
bottle caps. Father won.

652
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,459
Oh, what a pity. I take it
that the banjo is your instrument.

653
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,493
Oh, no, the mandolin.
The flat-back mandolin.

654
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,170
Alright, you're on.
What do you want to play?

655
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,892
How about
"I'm Yours"?

656
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,011
That's a tough
arrangement to play at sight.

657
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,932
I'll play anything
that's on the paper.

658
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,375
OK. How about you?

659
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,735
Pick one.

660
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,054
Alright, I'll leave the book with you.
Look 'em over.

661
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,293
Artie! On the question of who plays first,
may I suggest alphabetical order -

662
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,853
in the interest of fairness?

663
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,739
Sure, OK. Alright,
we're on in about three minutes.

664
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,172
What's the matter? Aren't you
going to look over your parts?

665
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,772
I couldn't hit a bad note
if I tried. Not tonight.

666
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,168
Why is tonight
an exception?

667
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,693
Oh, I don't know.

668
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,370
It makes all the difference when you
know someone's depending on you.

669
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,610
What?

670
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,218
Oh, nothing, nothing
nothing at all

671
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,969
Who's depending
on you?

672
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,015
Nobody. Forget it, Hank,
forget it.

673
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,537
Say, you were alone here
with Ellen when I came in.

674
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,651
For almost the first time
since I've known her.

675
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,368
Yeah? Well, what happened?
What did you say to her?

676
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,975
Look, Hank.
Ellen and I...

677
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,533
I don't suppose it's
any concern of yours,

678
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,369
but when I get set with Shaw,
Ellen and I...

679
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,054
You proposed to her.
What did she say?

680
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,049
She just looked at me and gave her
tender unspoken yes.

681
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,216
How do you know
it wasn't an unspoken no?

682
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,129
A fella can tell.

683
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,617
One of those rare occasions when
silence was more eloquent than words.

684
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,172
Yeah?

685
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,332
Yeah.

686
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,293
Alright. That's the way it is. I wish
you all the happiness in the world.

687
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,657
Have me over
for dinner sometime.

688
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,698
- Thanks, Hank.
- Alright.

689
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,698
I'm glad you're not gonna
let this come between us.

690
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,896
OK. Here we go.

691
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,416
Here we are, Danny. You know
what I wish you, Danny boy.

692
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,057
Yeah.

693
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,975
Fascinating music.

694
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,054
I can't understand it.

695
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,294
Well, that was just dandy.
I'll be sure and call you.

696
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,616
In the meanwhile, if anything
else comes up, take it!

697
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,339
You sure you know
what you're doing?

698
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,216
Say the word.

699
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,740
OK, fellas.
Here we go - one, two.

700
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,171
See what I mean?
I've even got music in my feet.

701
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,296
Excuse me.

702
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,575
Well, have you finished, the both
of you? You've ruined everything.

703
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,016
After all you've pretended
to think of me.

704
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,495
After I've tried so hard.
After Artie went...

705
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,175
Please, I never want to see
either of you again.

706
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,818
Danny O'Neill?
Who have you played with?

707
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,414
Er - O'Neill's Perennials.

708
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,616
Never heard of them.

709
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,569
Have you heard of
Artie Shaw?

710
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,014
Oh, were you associated
with him?

711
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,090
Associated with him?

712
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,809
I made a deeper impression on him
than any trumpet player he ever heard.

713
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,529
One moment please.

714
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,896
Artie, there was one thing about
last night. Maybe I shouldn't bring it up.

715
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,055
Now, wait a minute.
If it's about those...

716
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,059
No, no, no. It's about Mr. Chisholm.
No, I mean it.

717
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:37,377
Yeah? Who? Him? Are you kiddin'?
Well, throw him out.

718
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,530
Anything serious?

719
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,890
Naw!

720
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,733
- Out!
- Alright.

721
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,734
Hello. Tell Tommy that
Hank Taylor's here, will you?

722
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,459
Get off the desk.

723
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,053
Uh? Alright.

724
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,540
Of course, Mr. Chisholm
talks a lot but he's sweet.

725
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,857
He says he has the soul of an artist
but that his money's stifling it.

726
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,937
Now, you've always wanted
to give a concert.

727
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,732
I know I can get him
to back you.

728
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,015
How do I know he's different from those
crunchy, crinkle breakfast food guys?

729
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,369
They've all got some angle.

730
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,810
Alright, I'll guarantee to get him
without one string attached.

731
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,050
- No musts about what I should play?
- None.

732
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,176
- No bottle cap ads?
- Honor bright.

733
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,049
- OK. Sounds swell if you can do it.
- Good. I'll get to work on it right away.

734
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,850
Yeah? What? Him?
Throw him out.

735
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,772
Alright. Now wait a minute, I've got
offers from Miller, Duchin, Goodman.

736
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,779
I got plenty of jobs.
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

737
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,409
I think I'll put a small wager
on Magic Melody.

738
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,734
Lester, you're wonderful.

739
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,612
Always willing to back
something musical.

740
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,219
Artists need a man
like you.

741
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,495
You think so?

742
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,098
Old English hunting song,
I believe.

743
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,659
My dear, are you choking?

744
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,412
This place was one of my finds.

745
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,848
They're all real musicians.

746
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,419
Too bad they're not
better known.

747
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,489
Ellen, you remember what you said -
I might be able to help?

748
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,574
Why can't I give
these musicians to the world?

749
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,055
Oh, but your first duty
is to the American artists.

750
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,653
Oh, yes. So it is.

751
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,851
Look at him. Centuries of Slavic
balance have gone into that dance.

752
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,091
Vos goot!

753
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,655
Vos goot? Vos perfect!

754
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,015
He's miles away. Perhaps dreaming
of a little girl on the Steppes of Russia.

755
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,540
You can tell by his face
he's loved and suffered.

756
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,975
Oh, please take me home,
I can't stand any more of this.

757
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,852
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you letting me back this concert.

758
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,289
Not at all, not at all.

759
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,773
And how grateful I am
to you, Ellen.

760
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,979
To think, after all these years,
I'm back in my true medium.

761
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,776
By the way, how much
did you say I should arrange for?

762
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,734
Er, roughly fifteen thousand.

763
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,339
Oh, wouldn't you say
that twenty would be safer?

764
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,532
After all, J. Lester Chisholm
must stand for nothing but the best.

765
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,454
There she goes, there she goes -
always thinking of me.

766
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,089
I can't tell you what a jewel
you have in this little girl.

767
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,699
I'm finding out every day.

768
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,373
And what an inspiration.

769
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,010
Mother thinks that every girl
who's attracted to me

770
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,368
is after the
Chisholm money.

771
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,973
Come in. Oh, Lester.

772
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,134
Stay where you are.

773
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,016
Don't move.

774
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,374
You don't know what a picture
you make in the candlelight.

775
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,853
Lester, you've brought
your mandolin.

776
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:24,932
For you.

777
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,495
Oh, you shouldn't have.

778
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,015
Why not? Tonight's
our night to celebrate, isn't it?

779
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,291
I thought we might have
a quiet evening of music.

780
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,893
Just you and I.

781
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,092
I always say there's nothing
like duets to make a home a home.

782
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,617
- Can I use your house phone, please?
- Certainly.

783
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,659
- Who do you wish to speak to?
- Miss Miller.

784
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,772
- Who's calling?
- Mr. er... Dunn.

785
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,015
Oh, Mr. Dunn.

786
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,176
Hello.

787
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,813
Hello, Ellen. It's me, Danny.

788
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,693
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

789
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,612
I'm downstairs.
And I thought maybe I could...

790
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:08,093
No, I can't see you tonight.
No, I'm not being vindictive.

791
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,731
I just can't see you.
Of course, Hank isn't here.

792
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,136
Look, Danny,
I'll have to talk to you tomorrow.

793
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,699
No, he isn't.

794
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,813
Ellen, wait a minute.

795
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,615
Goodnight, Mr. Dunn.

796
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,495
Er, goodnight.

797
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,216
Mr. Dunn...

798
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,411
That was just an old college friend
I was talking to.

799
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,178
We won't be disturbed again,
Lester.

800
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,177
Shall we continue while
we're in the groove?

801
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,251
Beautiful Dreamer,
queen of my song.

802
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,255
List while I woo thee
with soft melody.

803
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,776
What was that?
B-flat.

804
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,130
No, I heard a noise.
Is there someone in there?

805
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,693
Hardly. That's my bedroom.

806
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,369
Now, don't be nervous.

807
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,569
I'm not a bit nervous.

808
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,779
See, just as I told you,
it's your imagination.

809
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,529
Grrr...

810
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,374
Yes boy, yes boy.

811
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,137
Sport, shut up.

812
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,610
Ouch!

813
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,692
Hank!

814
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,450
What do you hear
from the gang in college?

815
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,613
What do you think
you're doing under this bed?

816
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,694
Looking for a collar button.

817
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,132
I've got as much right
under here as you have.

818
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,977
Say, if you're in here,
I wonder who's out there?

819
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,290
That's right.
I thought it was you.

820
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,449
Better investigate.

821
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,697
No, wait a minute. We don't want
to upset Ellen - today of all days.

822
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,653
That's right.
Not today.

823
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,859
So that's why you came up.
I thought so.

824
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:40,975
What are you
talkin' about?

825
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,815
Well, you just happened to call on the
day Shaw announced his concert.

826
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,456
Well, I read something
about the concert in the paper.

827
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,650
But I'm much too
busy to help Artie out.

828
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,539
I'm working like a horse.

829
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,576
You're working?

830
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,257
Sure.

831
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,216
Not with Dorsey.

832
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,657
No. He wouldn't change his style
to suit me.

833
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,248
I've got a little engagement
just out of town.

834
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,092
I never had such
a big audience.

835
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,616
Fourth trumpet, huh?

836
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,850
No sir, boy.
Strictly solo stuff.

837
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,889
Why? Is the concert
the reason for your visit?

838
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,329
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

839
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,811
- I'm much too busy for that.
- Doin' what?

840
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,495
- After I quit Whiteman.
- You quit Whiteman?

841
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,332
Sure, too big a
band for me.

842
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,576
If I'd stayed with him,
I'd have lost my individuality.

843
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,179
Same thing happened
to Bix.

844
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,019
So you're unemployed,
huh?

845
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,337
No, not at all. I've just hooked up
with a terrific European outfit.

846
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,530
I never dreamed such
things could be done to music.

847
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,491
I wonder what's going on
out there?

848
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,697
Sounds as if she's giving
somebody an audition.

849
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,774
I never heard of Shaw with
a mandolin section.

850
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,768
- What about a breather?
- That's a wonderful idea!

851
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,136
- Sometimes it's a little tiring.
- Yes.

852
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,299
Let's have a toast
to the concert.

853
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,974
Ellen, you've
made me feel like a boy again.

854
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,010
Really?

855
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,092
You've made me believe
that money really isn't a handicap.

856
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,179
That's what I want you
to believe, Lester.

857
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,653
To think,
after all these years,

858
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,008
I've something to look forward to.

859
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,174
- Well, to our big night.
- To our big night.

860
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,733
She's being
taken advantage of.

861
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,658
She seems to be liking it.

862
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,616
I've seen that fella before.
Where was it?

863
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,014
At the Russian restaurant -
The Little Bear.

864
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,577
The Little Wolf. I saw him
with her at the racetrack.

865
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,539
- We've got to get her out of this.
- What are we waitin' for?

866
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,734
- Would you have another glass?
- I don't think I should.

867
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,736
Well, you know best.

868
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,298
That's what I admire
about you, Ellen.

869
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,729
You're so different
from the other girls in this town.

870
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,771
Oh. I can hardly
believe that, Lester.

871
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,128
You wouldn't.
You're so innocent.

872
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,057
You wouldn't believe
the carryings-on.

873
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,899
Oh, I've been told things.

874
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,379
What's that?
Somebody out there.

875
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,212
You're just imagining
things again.

876
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,290
No, look.

877
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,775
What in the world?

878
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,976
He's not home,
is he, Ellen?

879
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,256
Who is it?

880
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,775
Danny!

881
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,020
Oh, er, it's just a neighbor.

882
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,576
He always wants to borrow the lawn-
mower or something. Excuse me.

883
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,691
Danny, Danny, is it you?

884
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,498
Is that guy here again?
Pardon me, Mr...

885
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,536
Chisholm.

886
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,249
Oh, Chisholm, yes.
Ellen told me about you.

887
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,415
Yeah, I guess she's
getting rid of him.

888
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,250
Well, she'd better.

889
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,698
You know, I told her flatly -
I said it's either him or me.

890
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,896
You know, I used to
trust that guy.

891
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,894
I went to college with him. I shared
my room, my tie, my troubles.

892
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,773
But I won't share Ellen.

893
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,572
You don't blame me,
do you?

894
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,811
I didn't know.
I think I'd better be going.

895
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,771
No, I didn't mean you.
Stick around.

896
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,769
Make yourself at home.
Do you need anything?

897
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,412
No.

898
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,899
Glad to have met you.

899
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,573
Oh, mercy!

900
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,252
Danny,
how dare you come up here?

901
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,609
I'm glad I came up.

902
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,173
Well, I'm not.
Get off this roof this instant.

903
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,528
You need me, Ellen.

904
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,257
What?

905
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,608
Oh, I'm not blaming you
for one moment, but.

906
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,735
What are you
talking about?

907
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,929
He's not the kind of person
to be around you.

908
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,453
You don't know
what you're getting into.

909
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,089
Of course, it's not your fault.
Hank and I both realize that.

910
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,494
Hank? Is he here
too?

911
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,372
Yes, he's inside
taking care of the details.

912
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,609
Good heavens!

913
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,730
Oh, dear.

914
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,090
Lester! Lester, wait a minute -
Lester.

915
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,499
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

916
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,769
But I'm not married.

917
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,776
Then who's that man?

918
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,055
Oh, that was just Hank.

919
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,172
Ellen, I can't believe it.
You of all people.

920
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,093
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

921
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,335
Well, you mustn't
be so upset.

922
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,449
I'll send him away.

923
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,894
Now, don't make
it worse, Ellen.

924
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,732
I can't stand it.
I can't stand it.

925
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,652
I'm leaving for Cincinnatti
in the morning.

926
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,896
Cinncinnatti?
Well, what about the concert?

927
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,378
Well, you can tell Mr. Shaw how much
I appreciate the chance he gave me.

928
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,298
Under the circumstances
I can't accept it.

929
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,617
Oh, but Lester you can't throw away
your whole musical career.

930
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:13,456
My musical career is over.
Here, I'll never touch it again.

931
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,017
Oh, he said "I didn't know."

932
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,773
- Poor Mr. Chisholm.
- Poor Mr. Chisholm

933
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:27,412
Poor Mr. Chisholm
played on the mandolin

934
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,858
But he couldn't win
Cos he tried to swing

935
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,938
And he broke a string
every time.

936
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,336
Oh, he says -
"I'd better be going."

937
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:44,858
Poor Mr. Chisholm.
Just couldn't dig the jive.

938
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,978
When he did arrive
at the proper note - he...

939
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,855
Now look Ellen.

940
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,730
Now, this is all
for the best

941
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,253
What we did may have
been a little drastic.

942
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,614
Yes, it may seem
a little brutal at first.

943
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,456
But you'll thank us
for it later.

944
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,533
So I'll thank you for it.

945
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,537
I suppose that Artie'll
thank you for it too.

946
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,499
Artie?
What do you mean, Artie?

947
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,013
What's Artie got to do
with Mr. Chisholm?

948
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,533
Nothing.
Nothing in the world.

949
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,497
He was only the backer
of the concert.

950
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,216
Concert?

951
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,295
Oh!

952
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,335
Alright, let's go again.
Shh!

953
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,569
Ellen, you've got
to listen to me.

954
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,889
There's only one thing
I've got to do.

955
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:33,292
Tell Artie the concert is off. Then
leave town by the first train I can get.

956
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,928
Ellen, you can't. I'm awfully
sorry about all this trouble.

957
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,012
I wouldn't hurt you for the world.
You know how I feel about you.

958
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,410
Remember the other night,
when I took the vocal?

959
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,930
I wasn't kidding.

960
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,258
There's one part I remember -
the merry-go-round I'll lead you.

961
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,333
- You weren't kidding.
- That's over, the merry-go-round is out.

962
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,973
- No, Danny. It's too late.
- No, it isn't.

963
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,091
Go back in and act
as if nothing's happened -

964
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,250
I'll have Chisholm
back here in an hour.

965
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,170
What can you do?

966
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,053
Don't worry. Just don't say anything
to Shaw until I get back.

967
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,090
What can I say?

968
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,336
You can do it. Give me an hour.

969
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,731
Alright, Danny.
One hour.

970
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,010
That's right.

971
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,017
Hurry up,
he's checking out.

972
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,053
What 20,000?

973
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,573
Oh, that 20,000.

974
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:24,934
Send it back
to Cinncinnatta.

975
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,209
I'm going back
there myself.

976
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,815
On second thought,
Joe, you just leave it where it is.

977
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,218
You bounder.
Leave this room immediately.

978
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,058
Mr. Chisholm, I brought
you your mandolin.

979
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,539
I won't listen.
Leave this room.

980
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,691
Take it easy. You're going to listen
whether you want to or not.

981
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,339
We've come
to clear Ellen's name.

982
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,491
I won't hear her name
mentioned in my presence.

983
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,099
Oh, now don't
say that, Mr. Chisholm.

984
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,970
Who are you?

985
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,977
I'm a man who
wants to see justice done.

986
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,173
- Alright, talk.
- No, I can't.

987
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,899
- Come clean.
- Alright.

988
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,976
Mr. Chisholm,
I have a confession to make.

989
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,577
I've never done this before
in my life. I lied to you.

990
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,889
- Go on.
- Alright.

991
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,369
Ellen is innocent.

992
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,456
Innocent?
I saw with my own eyes.

993
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,933
He framed her deliberately.

994
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,938
Impulsively.
I am not Ellen's husband.

995
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,574
I know that.
Who are you?

996
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,815
Me?

997
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,898
He's her -
her brother, Hank.

998
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,954
Aren't you ashamed?

999
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,488
Why did you endeavor
to create this false impression?

1000
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,971
I - I - I was trying
to protect her.

1001
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:20,697
Hit it.

1002
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,892
We didn't know who you were.

1003
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,089
And how much
you meant to her.

1004
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,336
You're just about
the most important man in her life.

1005
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,418
Oh, I didn't realize.
Oh, what have I done?

1006
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,650
You've acted shabbily.

1007
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,538
You have misjudged
a wonderful girl.

1008
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,053
Jumped to brutal
conclusions.

1009
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,529
Oh, dear. Do you think
she'll ever forgive me?

1010
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,770
Well, there's a chance -
if you go about it in the right way.

1011
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,692
Yes, if you crawl back
to her on your hands and knees.

1012
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,213
And beg her
to forgive and forget.

1013
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,572
Oh, I will. Do you think this will interfere
with letting me back the concert?

1014
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,534
Well, I don't think so.

1015
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,128
No. Ellen isn't small.
But you'd better hurry.

1016
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,774
Oh, I will. I'll get my hat
and gloves.

1017
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,733
Er, you make yourselves
at home.

1018
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,579
Poor Mr. Chisholm.

1019
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,930
Well, we've finally
done right by our Ellen.

1020
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:02,850
It's about time.

1021
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,415
Yeah. Makes you
feel good, doesn't it?

1022
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,176
You know, self-sacrifice,
doing unto others.

1023
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,011
That's the life.

1024
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,898
Yeah, but a little self-sacrifice
goes a long way.

1025
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,898
We ought to think of our
own careers for a change.

1026
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:20,573
After all, we are the intimate friends
of Shaw's backer.

1027
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,496
No, we mustn't use Chisholm.

1028
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,090
We owe it to Ellen not to
take any more chances.

1029
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,899
Oh, no. Ellen won't respect
a couple of failures.

1030
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,328
It's true if it wasn't for us
the concert would be off.

1031
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,094
Certainly.
He owes us a break.

1032
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,100
Here I go. Boys, if there's ever
anything I can do.

1033
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,336
Nonsense, Mr. Chisholm.
We're glad to do a good turn.

1034
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,859
If there's anything
we can do for you.

1035
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,413
Oh, you've already
done enough.

1036
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,373
Oh, I mean helping you
select numbers for the concert

1037
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,250
and that sort of thing.

1038
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,371
You see, I don't select
the numbers for the concert.

1039
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,292
Why, I hardly dare
venture an opinion.

1040
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,296
But you should.

1041
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,178
After all,
I'm only the backer.

1042
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,136
Only the backer?

1043
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,256
Why, Mr. Chisholm,
you're the impresario.

1044
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,655
The most important man
in the entire organization.

1045
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,333
You've got to be
the guiding hand.

1046
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,216
Choose the music.

1047
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,011
Pick the men.

1048
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:06,697
It's your duty.

1049
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,418
Think of the other backers.
You're letting them down.

1050
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,416
You're letting Shaw down.

1051
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,539
This is terrible. Why didn't anyone
ever tell me this before?

1052
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,850
Why, I would have been
delighted to do it.

1053
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,777
- It's not too late.
- Not if you work fast.

1054
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,255
I don't know which way to start.
What would you suggest?

1055
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,012
First of all,
line up a number.

1056
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,688
That's a good idea,
but off-hand I can't think.

1057
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,452
Oh, sure you remember the...

1058
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,656
rolling-back-to-mammy-
on-the-big-river blues.

1059
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,136
Rolling back to mammy
on the big river blues.

1060
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,177
- That's it, he's got it.
- He's got it.

1061
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,256
Now, don't be too hasty.

1062
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,092
Perhaps I can think
of something better.

1063
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,415
What about
a folk song?

1064
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,416
A folk song.

1065
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,099
I've got just the
number for you.

1066
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,255
Listen to this.

1067
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,969
Oh, you're gonna
like this Chis.

1068
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,177
This is back to the good earth,
full of sweep - play that, Danny.

1069
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,773
I like that.
What's it called?

1070
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,413
"Hoe-down the bayou."

1071
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,771
Do you hear that?
That's New Orleans.

1072
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,339
I visited there.
Three weeks.

1073
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:00,776
I don't recognize it.

1074
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,651
You don't?

1075
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,054
Well, that's the spirit
of New Orleans.

1076
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,409
I can almost smell
the Delta.

1077
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,689
I can smell the Delta.

1078
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,129
Can't you smell
the Delta?

1079
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,814
I have a slight cold.

1080
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,698
Well, nothing that
your mandolin won't cure.

1081
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,450
Now you pick this up,
Chis. Pick it up, boy.

1082
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,818
Yeah, yeah, come on, son.
The train won't wait.

1083
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,450
That's it.
Now, we're sailin' up that river

1084
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,692
on the Memphis, Chattanooga.
Hold on, Chis.

1085
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:27,849
Hear them steamboat whistles blowin.'
Tote that barge, pull that bale.

1086
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:32,338
There's a cabin in the cotton,
Solid South, solid North, solid Jack.

1087
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,451
Solid Jack.

1088
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,088
Right, wagon wheels-a-creakin'
Westward.

1089
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,969
Now, we're rollin' past that junction
on to Kansas, Cincinnatti.

1090
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,573
Cincinnatti, my home town.

1091
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:45,972
His hometown, your hometown,
everybody's hometown. Cincinatti!

1092
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,337
Boys, words fail me.
I must see Shaw at once.

1093
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,735
That's the spirit, Chisholm.
Don't let America down.

1094
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,894
You sure it's my duty
as a backer?

1095
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,736
You can do anything.

1096
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,258
Anything?

1097
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:57,977
Certainly.

1098
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,490
Alright. I'll not only see that this
epic-making number of yours

1099
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:03,498
is given the finest presentation
in the world, but I'll go further.

1100
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,494
I'll play in it myself -
on my mandolin.

1101
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:07,817
What?

1102
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,578
A rhythm in letter B.
I'll set the tempo at C.

1103
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:20,136
Trombones make a definite entrance.
Saxes come in good and strong,

1104
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,574
and strings pick it up
from there.

1105
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,374
- Ellen, can you ever forgive me?
- Oh Lester.

1106
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,651
I know I don't deserve it. I've let you
down in more ways than one.

1107
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,897
But I'm going to make up
for it right now.

1108
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,898
Shaw, can I see you
a minute.

1109
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,131
Hi!
Take ten, fellas.

1110
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,452
Hello Mr. Chisholm
glad you dropped in.

1111
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,890
I didn't just drop in Mr. Shaw.
Sit down please. And you Ellen.

1112
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,252
I realized I've shirked my duties
but I've got something to make up for it.

1113
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,456
A folk song for the concert,
it'll kill you.

1114
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:50,536
Folk song?

1115
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,656
It's got everything.
The sweep of the prairies,

1116
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,697
creaking of wagons,
the Mississippi.

1117
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,617
Sounds peachy.

1118
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,169
It goes like this.

1119
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,217
Da da da da da.

1120
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,009
Hoe down the bayou.

1121
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:02,295
Can't you smell the delta?

1122
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:10,214
Chattanooga, Louisiana,
solid North, solid South.

1123
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:14,619
Hoe down boy, hoo!
That's the steamboat whistle.

1124
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,973
That's my home town, your home
town, everybody's home town.

1125
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,055
Cincinatta!

1126
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:22,136
Are you kidding?

1127
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,215
It'll sweep the country.

1128
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,012
I insist that you play it
at the concert.

1129
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,779
If that's the way you feel about...

1130
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,773
- Prairies, wagons, steamboat whistles.
- That's its sweep.

1131
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,368
Listen Artie I've heard part of it.
It's not a bad song.

1132
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,539
How can I tell from that?
Get me someone who can play it.

1133
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,254
I'll get you the composer himself.
He's right outside, right away.

1134
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,776
I fixed it.

1135
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,452
Good boy Chis.

1136
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:44,177
You've done
a great job.

1137
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,489
Go in there and give 'em
all you've got.

1138
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,458
Maybe we'd better explain
about our secret.

1139
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,935
I could back you up
on the mandolin.

1140
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,095
No, no, no. Save it.

1141
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,579
You don't want to give
away the big surprise.

1142
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,775
No practice comes first.

1143
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,259
Besides you're no
song plugger.

1144
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,854
Would Heifetz go around
selling songs to band leaders?

1145
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,853
That's fine I'll stand by
and explain it as you play it.

1146
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,816
Er...

1147
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,052
We'd better stay out here, too many
people might make Shaw nervous.

1148
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,659
Well I might be needed.

1149
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,330
Come on down the lobby,
I'll buy you a cigar.

1150
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,210
I don't like cigars.

1151
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,098
Don't you worry about it
I'll smoke it myself.

1152
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,899
Artie he'll be here
in a minute.

1153
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,812
I know but I'm holding up
a whole rehearsal Ellen.

1154
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:18,850
Hello Mr. Shaw.

1155
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,932
Oh, it's you again,
huh?

1156
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,528
I guess so.

1157
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,574
You aren't going
to let something that's over

1158
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,611
stand in the way
of a good song?

1159
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,899
- OK. Let's hear it, this better be good.
- Yes sir.

1160
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,448
Poor Mr. Chisholm played
on the mandolin.

1161
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,331
But he couldn't win.

1162
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:50,449
'Cos he tried to swing
and he broke a string, every time.

1163
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:57,537
Poor Mr. Chisholm
just couldn't dig the jive.

1164
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,735
When he did arrive
at the proper note,

1165
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,698
he arrived by boat,
every time.

1166
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,890
He tried to jazz up
his mandolin.

1167
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,451
But never could
quite control it.

1168
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:18,615
He always brought
Bach and Handel in.

1169
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,376
When he took a lick,
he always broke a pick.

1170
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:27,690
Poor Mr. Chisholm
you're quite a gay old blade

1171
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,459
with your serenade.

1172
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,298
But you're corny Jack,

1173
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,657
better truck on back
to the buke.

1174
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,494
Get a uke.

1175
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:42,009
You disgraced your kin
on the mandolin, every time.

1176
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,570
- Did you like the tune Artie?
- Kinda cute.

1177
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:52,051
Make an arrangement of it
and maybe we can find a spot for it.

1178
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,289
But remember
no trouble this time.

1179
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,092
Don't worry Mr. Shaw.
And thanks a lot.

1180
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,895
Mr. Chisholm playing a mandolin,
that'll really be something.

1181
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,177
Alright Ben,
call the boys.

1182
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,011
I'm within the hour.
Chilsholm is back.

1183
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,529
I'm making an arrangement.
You see Ellen I've settled down.

1184
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,735
The merry-go-round's out.

1185
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,653
Out nothing, you just happen
to get the brass ring.

1186
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,576
- This is your big chance, Danny.
- I hope.

1187
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,091
- Did he understand it?
- Did he go for it?

1188
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,654
- Hook, line and Cincinatti.
- Nice going boy!

1189
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:26,378
Wonderful!
Calls for a celebration.

1190
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,649
Attaboy Danny.

1191
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,768
- Fellow artists, I give you the concert.
- We accept it.

1192
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,299
Lester we're proud
of you.

1193
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,775
Oh Ellen,
I'm only the backer.

1194
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,493
That's a very important
role Lester.

1195
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:42,730
It's not as though
I was a real contributor,

1196
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,731
as though I was one
of the performers.

1197
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,136
Well, now look...
We just about killed this bottle.

1198
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,057
What kind of a host are you?
How about a refill?

1199
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,136
Oh excuse me,
of course, of course.

1200
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,534
Oh, you won't tell her
while I'm gone?

1201
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,293
- Not a chance.
- Don't worry about it.

1202
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,535
Lester, wait a minute,
tell me what?

1203
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:07,088
It's just a little surprise. Let's tell her.
I'm gonna play in the concert.

1204
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,775
Lester you're not.

1205
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,896
Well I am,
I knew you'd be delighted.

1206
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:16,176
What am I standing here for?
Wine is what we need, wine.

1207
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,216
So the merry-go-round
is still on?

1208
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,416
We couldn't help it,
all we did was flatter him a bit.

1209
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,178
If we disillusioned him,
he'd call the whole thing off.

1210
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,655
- What do you suppose Shaw will do?
- Shaw will never find out.

1211
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,054
Hank's going to keep
Chisholm away from him.

1212
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,738
Me? Oh no!

1213
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,969
But I'll be busy
with my arrangement.

1214
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,172
Alright I'll make a bargain
with you.

1215
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,609
You get me a job with Shaw
with a nice fat trumpet part

1216
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,849
and I'll look after
Chisholm.

1217
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,373
Oh sure.
I'll do my best.

1218
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,770
You'll do better
than that or else.

1219
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,016
- That'll get 'em Artie.
- Oh, it was wonderful.

1220
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,255
Glad you like it.

1221
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,369
Here's my
arrangement.

1222
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,377
Oh fine. You make all the
changes we talked about.

1223
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,650
Yeah, but I don't know
how good it'll sound after that.

1224
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,055
Artie, there's one little favor
I want to ask you.

1225
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,450
You're gonna use some extra
trumpets. I know a fella that...

1226
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,452
Not that partner of yours,

1227
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,889
that guy can't get through number
without falling off the stand.

1228
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,689
Nothin' doin', period.
We'll run over this in the morning.

1229
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,096
Danny, what are we going to do
about poor Hank?

1230
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,017
It's going to be tough
but we'll keep on trying.

1231
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,057
Ninety-six, two, three, seven...
Two, three... ninety-eight...

1232
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:57,289
Two, three, ninety-nine... Two, three
and one hundred and stop.

1233
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,213
One hundred times
without a slip.

1234
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,896
No, no. You were pretty fuzzy
on thirty-seven.

1235
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,939
You were a quarter
beat off on seventy-six.

1236
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,655
Now you take one more
hundred and we'll turn in.

1237
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,811
No, now it's just two days
before the concert.

1238
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,532
I'd better go down
and tell Artie our secret.

1239
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,653
No not yet.
It's too late tonight anyhow.

1240
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,015
It isn't, the band's
staying late to rehearse.

1241
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,858
You haven't
practiced enough.

1242
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,853
I've practiced for ten days,
twelve hours a day,

1243
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,534
six hours a night.
I'll go stale.

1244
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,775
Are you ready?

1245
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:37,256
One... Two...

1246
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,055
Tonight at 8:30,

1247
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:47,252
Artie Shaw will present an interesting
newcomer to the musical world.

1248
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,690
Interesting newcomer
that must mean me.

1249
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,575
What?
Yes sure, sure, sure.

1250
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,136
Henry, are you worried
about the rehearsal?

1251
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,332
Me no.
Is it worrying you?

1252
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:01,175
Not at all. There are few troubles
that a good nights sleep won't cure.

1253
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,058
Look you watch
your own health,

1254
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,455
I've got insomnia.

1255
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,210
Insomnia, that's too bad
you should er...

1256
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,051
Come in.

1257
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,049
Good afternoon
Mr. Chisholm.

1258
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,097
Hello,
well what about a drink?

1259
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:13,777
Good idea.

1260
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,460
I'll be right back.
I just want to spruce up a bit.

1261
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,653
Hello. Give me
the Majestic Theatre, will you?

1262
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,168
It's better so...

1263
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,136
What? What's that?
What about her?

1264
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:40,531
Yeah. Wait a minute, excuse me Chis,
this is a personal matter.

1265
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,252
Say Danny you wouldn't lie to me
at a time like this, would you?

1266
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,094
It's all set, you're in!
You gotta' get down here right away.

1267
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,019
Well this makes up for
a lot of things Danny.

1268
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,653
What Chisholm?

1269
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:58,815
Wait a minute don't you worry
about Chisholm.

1270
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,337
I just got a plan
to keep him here.

1271
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,934
You bet, so long.

1272
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,570
- Good news?
- It depends on your point of view.

1273
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,412
One man's drink is
another man's poison.

1274
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,970
Yeah... Well Henry everything
happens for the best.

1275
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:23,014
You know it's always
darkest just before dawn.

1276
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:23,977
S'right.

1277
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:26,859
The lad worthwhile is the lad
who can smile

1278
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,215
when the rest of the word's
gone wrong.

1279
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,773
Right, right as rain.

1280
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,019
We'll have it over here.

1281
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,697
Henry if ever anything
comes between us,

1282
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:45,254
always remember I had your
best interest at heart.

1283
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,859
That cuts both ways
partner.

1284
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,615
- Well happy days.
- Happy dreams.

1285
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,219
Bottoms up.

1286
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:01,770
Bottoms up.

1287
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,178
There must be
some answer.

1288
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,735
Well never mind.

1289
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,459
I can't raise Hank anywhere.

1290
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:47,174
He'll never believe
I didn't have anything to do with this.

1291
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,974
Last week I'd been sure
you had, but this week no.

1292
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,375
You know you're improving
so amazingly Danny

1293
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,457
I think I'll make you
my manager.

1294
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,696
Thank you.

1295
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,616
Ladies and gentlemen
we have a little blues number,

1296
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:11,016
which recently came to my attention
bearing the somewhat ambiguous title,

1297
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,699
"Hoedown the Bayou".

1298
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,331
Since then it has grown up and been
transformed into something special.

1299
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,492
Before playing it, I'd like to introduce
the man who wrote it: Danny O'Neil.

1300
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:22,417
Go on.

1301
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,491
How do you feel?

1302
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:30,531
Alright.

1303
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,817
OK. It's all yours.

1304
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:20,850
Danny you were
wonderful.

1305
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,130
Nice work Danny!
I'm gonna' have to hire you after all.

1306
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:23,818
Thanks Artie.

1307
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,733
Only because I don't want
to lose a good secretary.

1308
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,534
Artie Shaw, Artie Shaw!

1309
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:37,855
Nobody.

1310
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:46,658
Ninety-nine... One hundred...
Take it again.

1311
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:55,094
I hope in your horoscope
there is room for a dope,

1312
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,415
who adores you.

1313
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,814
Vas goot!

1314
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,892
Vas perfect!

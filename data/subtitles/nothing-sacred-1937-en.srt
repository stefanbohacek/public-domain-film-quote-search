1
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,169
Ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:21,904
When the Morning Star
summoned you to this banquet

3
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:25,074
I realized that there were
only two people qualified

4
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:28,121
to introduce the great man
we are honoring tonight.

5
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,717
Either my humble self or that
pearl among journalists

6
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,580
Mr. Wallace Cook, my great
friend and star reporter.

7
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,190
You said it.

8
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:42,487
I want Mr. Cook himself to tell
you the great feat he performed

9
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,050
not only for the Morning Star,
but for mankind itself

10
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:50,404
in interesting our guest of
honor in this great project.

11
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,869
Twenty-seven halls of
learning and culture!

12
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,843
Twenty-seven arenas of art!

13
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:13,294
To be known as the
Morning Star Temple.

14
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:18,935
And for every dollar we contribute, our
guest has pledged himself to give ten.

15
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:24,655
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my
great honor to introduce to you

16
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:28,535
A prince with a heart as
big as his pocketbook

17
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:32,882
that fabulous and magnificent
potentate of the Orient

18
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:35,341
the Sultan of Marzipan.

19
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:47,746
Peace be unto you, my friends.

20
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,933
Peace and the blessings of culture.

21
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,792
That's him.
That's my husband.

22
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,800
Well, my fine
Oriental potentate

23
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,956
I'm not going to have you arrested.

24
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:37,424
I'm going to put you on the payroll
as a janitor!

25
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:39,846
Thank you, sir.

26
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,654
And I always want you
present in the local room

27
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:48,429
Where my reporters and Mr. Wallace
Cook can drink you in constantly

28
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,125
As a warning against fakes!

29
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:53,795
Yeah, sir.

30
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,180
May I ask, ain't Mr.
Cook a reporter anymore?

31
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:02,420
I wouldn't like for him to lose his job.
He was very nice to me.

32
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,993
Mr. Cook is not going to be
discharged, Your Majesty.

33
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,075
For his own good and the
good of the Morning Star

34
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,186
I am going to remove him
from the land of the living!

35
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,890
Listen, Oliver, I tell
you I'm innocent.

36
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,588
I was just as fooled by old
black Joe as you were.

37
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,986
I believed everything he
said just as you did.

38
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,125
Now, Oliver.

39
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:29,107
Either you cut out these fat-headed monkeyshines
of yours and let bygones be bygones

40
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:31,387
or I'm walking out of this
fish trap right here and now.

41
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,894
You're under contract with the
Star for five more years.

42
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:36,223
You're not in a position to resign

43
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:39,703
unless you wish to retire from
journalistic efforts over that period.

44
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:44,194
Oliver, you're not gonna keep me
pounding out obituaries for five years?

45
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,410
Those are my plans, Mr. Cook.

46
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:49,797
That's gratitude.

47
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:53,403
I'm the best reporter you ever had.

48
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,604
I've handed you a hundred scoops.

49
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,513
It isn't fair, Oliver.
It isn't human.

50
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Shut up!

51
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,141
Oliver, I... I don't like
to say this, but...

52
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,013
The paper is going to rack and ruin with
me hidden away in that water cooler.

53
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,481
- Look at this.
- What's that?

54
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:13,446
Poor little working girl doomed
to death from radium poisoning.

55
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,357
- We've covered it.
- Covered it?

56
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,842
You're getting old, Oliver.

57
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:21,165
Look, there's 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 lines on Hazel Flagg.

58
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,805
A poor little kid with a few
months to live at the outside.

59
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,983
Doomed. Death staring
her in the face.

60
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:27,867
What does she feel?
What does she think?

61
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,458
- Radium eating away her bones!
- Don't shout at me!

62
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,522
Listen, Oliver, there's a story in this
kid that ought to tear your heart out.

63
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,772
Where is it? Why hasn't the Star got it?
I'll tell you.

64
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Because I'm stuck away in the water cooler
on account of some whim of yours.

65
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:40,696
Listen, Oliver, give
me a chance, will you?

66
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,793
So help me may I drop
dead or redeem myself.

67
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:45,448
- I oughta be shot for what I'm thinking.
- What are you thinking?

68
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:49,348
I'm thinking that maybe you ain't the
most tittering imbecile on Earth.

69
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,683
I'm thinking that maybe
you've learned your lesson.

70
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:54,153
Oliver, so help me. I'll
be in Vermont by morning.

71
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:57,840
I'll dig you up a story that'll make
this town swoon. Here's my hand on it.

72
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:04,505
I've been through an inferno.

73
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,533
I haven't been able to enter a
café for the past three weeks

74
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:09,568
without the band playing "Dixie".

75
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,150
- Oh well, that was a coincidence.
- I've given you my hand, go on...

76
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,832
- Redeem yourself.
- Thanks. You won't regret it.

77
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,416
If I don't come back with the
biggest story you ever handled

78
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,333
you can put me back in short
pants and make me marble editor.

79
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:57,616
- You through?
- Yep.

80
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,300
- You know this girl, Hazel Flagg?
- Yep.

81
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,825
- Pretty girl, eh?
- Yep.

82
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:08,342
- Where is she now? In the hospital?
- Nope.

83
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:12,008
Just walking around, eh? Laughing
and carrying on, I suppose.

84
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,441
Yep.

85
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,106
- What's your name, Coolidge?
- Nope.

86
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,827
Well, if you aren't worn
out talking, what is it?

87
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:22,462
Bull.

88
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:26,069
Mr. Bull, my name's Cook.
I'm from the New York Star.

89
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:31,371
I'm, uh, going to be filing a lot of
stuff with your telegraph office here.

90
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:34,398
- I don't think you are.
- Well, who says?

91
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:38,911
The Paragon Watch Factory owns this town.
They don't care to have any scandal printed.

92
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:42,571
What they say goes.
Better take the next train back.

93
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:46,189
- What kind of a fellow is this Dr. Downer?
- He won't talk to you.

94
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:50,503
Nobody talkin' in this town.
Except me. Better go home.

95
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:55,753
Well, if you don't mind I'll take a little
stroll and have a look at the sights first.

96
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,965
Well, I wouldn't have talked at all if
I knew I was gonna do it for nothin'.

97
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:00,054
Oh, pardon me.

98
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:03,543
I forgot I was in Vermont.

99
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:12,268
All right.

100
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,584
Morning, sister.

101
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,644
- You in charge here?
- Yep.

102
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:28,305
I've been wandering through your
fascinating metropolis for an hour.

103
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,995
- Mind if I sit down here?
- Yep.

104
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:35,330
- I guess you misunderstood me.
- Nope.

105
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:43,214
- You know Hazel Flagg?
- Yep.

106
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,137
Any idea where I could
find her this morning?

107
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,629
You're a newspaperman from New York.

108
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:52,429
- How did you guess that, sister?
- You was described to me.

109
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:55,089
Will Bull can shoot his mouth
off to all he wants, but not me

110
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,373
nor anybody else in this town.

111
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,611
This drugstore's run by the
Paragon Watch Company

112
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,361
and they don't want any scandalmonger
New Yorkers snoopin' around.

113
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:09,886
- OK, sister. And how much do I owe you?
- Well, you've tooken up my time...

114
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:15,538
Thank you very much. I'm sorry that
I've tooken up so much of your time.

115
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,414
Sorry.

116
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:06,847
- Oh. Good morning.
Is Dr. Downer in?

117
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:07,987
- Yep.

118
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,261
- Is that his office?
- Yep.

119
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:14,311
Would you tell him Mr. Cook
would like to see him?

120
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:15,672
Tell him yourself.

121
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,804
- Dr. Downer?
- Yep!

122
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,386
My name's Cook. I'm up
here from New York.

123
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,109
Sit down. I'll be
with you in a minute.

124
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,651
- Nice day... Yep.
- Yep.

125
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:48,950
- What have you got, young man?
Hives?

126
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,580
No. No hives.

127
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:55,089
Lotta hives goin' around. Mrs. George
Nasher was took yesterday. Do you know her?

128
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:56,163
Nope.

129
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,684
- Where did you say you were from?
- New York.

130
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:04,849
I was wondering if you you could tell
me where I could find Hazel Flagg.

131
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:07,060
- From New York, eh?
- Yep.

132
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,608
You know what I
think, young fella?

133
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,171
I think you're a newspaperman.
I can smell 'em.

134
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:15,478
I've always been able to smell 'em.
Excuse me while I open the windows.

135
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:21,911
I'll tell you briefly what
I think of newspapermen.

136
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:25,770
The hand of God reaching
down into the mire

137
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:29,762
Couldn't elevate one of them
to the depths of degradation.

138
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:31,454
Not by a million miles.

139
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,357
I think you're being a little
severe toward my profession.

140
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,391
- Not much, but just a little.
- Nothing of the sort.

141
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:40,730
I'm a fair-minded man, young fella, but
when you've been robbed, swindled, cheated

142
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:43,688
for 22 years out of a fortune, it's
pardonable to formulate an opinion!

143
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:46,951
- From New York, eh?
- Yep.

144
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:50,296
You don't happen to know of a
newspaper called the Morning Star?

145
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,932
You have the honor, Dr. Downer,

146
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:55,811
of addressing that newspaper's
most gifted representative.

147
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:59,759
Moses in the mountains!
You're from the Morning Star?

148
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:01,581
Stay right where you are.
Don't move!

149
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:04,219
I'll show you something
that'll freeze ya!

150
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:07,651
Listen, doctor. I'm getting
sick of this taffy pull.

151
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,905
Where can I get hold
of Hazel Flagg?

152
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,999
Don't talk to me about Hazel Flagg!
No, siree!

153
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,560
Here's the evidence.

154
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,976
I appeal to you as a man of learning, Dr.
Downer. What is Miss Flagg's address?

155
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:23,585
Don't waste my time, young fella.
Here, read that.

156
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,815
That's a copy of an essay I wrote.
Read it. Go on.

157
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:27,853
Tit for tat.

158
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:31,578
Give me her address, and I'll pore over
these interesting documents all night.

159
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,113
I entered this contest with
a clean pair of hands.

160
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,323
Who are the six greatest Americans?

161
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:40,354
I named them and proved why,
writing on one side of the paper.

162
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:44,211
And what happened? Did I
win the $10,000? No, siree.

163
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:47,483
Did I win the 5,000? Did they
even try to save their face

164
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:50,419
by giving me one of the
smaller $1,000 prizes?

165
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,644
Not that gang of chicken thieves!

166
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,386
Here's what they gave me, read it.
A check for $1.

167
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,655
- Young fella, for 22 years...
- I must ask you to be reasonable.

168
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,910
- You can't harbor a grudge for 22 years.
- I'll harbor it till I die! Wait and see!

169
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,089
The Morning Star had a chance
to win my respect 22 years ago.

170
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,834
They saw fit to swindle and belittle me.
Very well.

171
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,837
I'll prove to them before I die
who the six great Americans are

172
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,393
And who was entitled
to the first prize!

173
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,355
I could do better in darkest Africa.

174
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,324
You know who got that $10,000?
The editor's wife, that's who!

175
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,458
Morning.

176
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:50,337
You don't have to sit there
looking so dramatic, Hazel.

177
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,095
Like Eliza crossing the ice.

178
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,292
Well, I can't help feeling a little bad.

179
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,498
You couldn't either if you
were gonna die any minute.

180
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,291
Well, you can stop giving yourself
the airs of a dying swan.

181
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,850
According to this last analysis
I made, you ain't going to die.

182
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:06,330
Unless you get run over or something.

183
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:07,527
What?

184
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:11,256
You heard me. I don't like
to chew my cabbage twice.

185
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,444
Enoch... Enoch, I-I-I'm
not gonna die?

186
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:19,142
You're fitter than a fiddle! And stop
gawking at me while I cut myself!

187
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:23,308
Oh, I gotta cry, Enoch.
I can't help it.

188
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,936
Come, come, come, this is no way
to behave in a doctor's office.

189
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:30,971
Besides, that soap will give you the
darndest bellyache you ever had.

190
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,592
Oh, Enoch, you saved my life.

191
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,592
Oh, it was nothing. That first
diagnosis I made was a mistake.

192
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:40,569
I got so that I was seeing
radium poisoning everywhere.

193
00:18:40,631 --> 00:18:43,964
I've been awfully brave, haven't I, not
to cry before? Please say I have...

194
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:50,239
Well, now that it's over, I don't mind telling
you, Hazel, I felt kinda sorry for you.

195
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,282
Sorry.

196
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:00,728
I've been under a great strain.

197
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:08,731
You know, I don't know why
I'm so happy about it, Enoch.

198
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:10,611
You sort of spoiled my trip.

199
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:13,904
What trip's that, Hazel?

200
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,896
You know, I was gonna take that
$200 you get for dying in Warsaw

201
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,554
And go to New York and blow
it all in and die happy.

202
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:21,595
And now I've got to stay in Warsaw.

203
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,122
So that's your gratitude to me?

204
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:28,129
For snatching you from
the jaws of death?

205
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:34,522
You know, I don't know which I am,
happy or miserable, I'm all mixed up.

206
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:37,938
Enoch, listen. Do you have to hand
in that report to the factory?

207
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,491
I know it sounds a little dishonest.

208
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:42,255
I'd do it like a shot, Hazel.

209
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,723
Only I'd lose my job the minute they
found out you weren't going to die.

210
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,320
And besides, there's the ethics.

211
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:54,099
Well. Oh, thanks for all your trouble.
I'm terribly grateful, Enoch.

212
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:01,512
Only it's kind of startling to
be brought to life twice...

213
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,530
And each time in Warsaw!

214
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:11,678
Miss Flagg?

215
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,710
Pardon me, I'm Wallace Cook
from the New York Star.

216
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,375
I came up to see you.

217
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:19,985
I know it's hard for you to talk, but if
you'd just listen to me for a while...

218
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,716
I have nothing to say now.
It's sort of too late.

219
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,370
I know how you feel, Miss Flagg.

220
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,570
But I won't ask you any
questions about your ailment.

221
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,491
I was just in to see Dr.
Downer, and he told me...

222
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,856
Now, please don't cry. I was thinking
while I was waiting for you to come out

223
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,988
and I got an idea. I want you
to come to New York with me.

224
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:37,183
- What?
- As my guest.

225
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:39,637
As the guest of the Morning Star. Now,
don't say anything till I tell you.

226
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:41,496
- Oh, I'm not saying anything.
- If you were my sister...

227
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:46,202
or somebody close to me, I'd take you
outta Warsaw dead or alive, Miss Flagg.

228
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,597
Oh, I've always wanted to see
the world outside before I...

229
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:51,805
- You've lived here all your life, huh?
- Twice as long.

230
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,513
You poor kid. You've
never been to New York?

231
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:56,401
No, my grandmother took me there when I
was three, but I didn't appreciate it.

232
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,704
Listen, we'll show you the town.
We'll take you everywhere.

233
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:01,065
You'll have more fun than if
you lived a hundred years

234
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:02,649
in this moth-eaten
yep-and-nope village.

235
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:05,148
- That's so very true...
- Is it a bargain?

236
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:07,435
I don't know. It would be
imposing on everybody because...

237
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:08,964
Imposing? In what way?

238
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:11,873
Oh, I just thought it'd be
wrong to make people sad.

239
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,346
- I'd be kind of a killjoy, wouldn't I?
- Listen, I'll be frank with you.

240
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:16,658
Even if I sound like a ghoul.
You'll be a sensation.

241
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,420
The whole town will
take you to its heart.

242
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,906
You'll have everything you've ever dreamed
of. You'll have it on a silver platter.

243
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:23,528
You'll be like Aladdin with
the magic lamp to rub.

244
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:27,047
You mean they'll like me
just because I'm dying?

245
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:28,733
Oh, that's a cruel way to put it.

246
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,465
No, they'll like you because you'll
be a symbol of courage and heroism.

247
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:36,004
- We'll talk about it on the plane.
- An aeroplane? You mean we'll fly there?

248
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:38,108
Sure. Sure, we haven't much time.

249
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:39,981
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean...

250
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,174
The sooner you get there, the more
time you'll have to enjoy yourself.

251
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:44,304
You know, I was gonna go there before.
I saved up an hundred dollars.

252
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,937
Now, a hundred million dollars couldn't buy
you the fun the Morning Star can give you.

253
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,207
- Come on.
- Oh no, wait. I gotta take him with me.

254
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,732
- Who? The kid on the bicycle?
- Oh no, no. Enoch. Dr. Downer.

255
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:53,664
You wait here. Oh, you
won't go away, will you?

256
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:55,992
- Nope.
- Oh, I'll go ask him. Will you wait here?

257
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:58,268
- Yep.
- Oh, good. Enoch! Enoch!

258
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,575
Oh, Enoch, look!

259
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:27,223
I don't care for scenery
from this point of view.

260
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:28,669
But that's the Statue of Liberty!

261
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,765
I've seen it.

262
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,886
I got in touch with Oliver.
Oliver Stone, my editor.

263
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,187
He's toe dancing in the
street waiting for us.

264
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:50,704
Oh, I hope he's nice like you.

265
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:53,016
Well, he's got a different
quality of charm.

266
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:56,085
He's sort of a cross between a
Ferris wheel and a werewolf.

267
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,123
But with a lovable streak -
if you care to blast for it.

268
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:01,077
- You're getting nervous?
- Oh no, no.

269
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:05,142
I just hope he won't have a lot of long-
whiskered doctors lined up to harass me.

270
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:08,026
You know, I'm not coming to New York to
play guinea pig for a lot of scientists.

271
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:10,439
Everybody knows that radium
poisoning is incurable

272
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:13,194
so... so why waste any
time in that direction?

273
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:17,359
Don't you worry about that.
You won't be bothered at all.

274
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,962
I'm not going to go to bed until I have
convulsions and my teeth start falling out.

275
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:22,994
That's when I begin
worrying, isn't it, Enoch?

276
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:25,563
It's as good a time as any.

277
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:29,436
- How're you feeling now, sailor?
- Hunky dory, Skipper.

278
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:33,963
Well, there she is, in all
her beads and ribbons.

279
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,918
- Mr. Cook?
- Yeah. Oh, thank you.

280
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,453
Oh, it's from Oliver. He's almost
tongue-tied with excitement.

281
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:50,472
He's... he's worked up
a nutty demonstration.

282
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:52,708
New York is going to lay
its heart at your feet

283
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,099
while the whistles blow and the
bands play and the cameras grind.

284
00:23:57,265 --> 00:24:00,365
How about you, sailor? Anything you
care to say as we go into action?

285
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:03,495
Oh, I'm going to have a marvelous
time. Whatever happens afterwards -

286
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:07,871
I mean about the convulsions and all that
- I'm going to have fun first… I am… I am…

287
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:09,997
Well, if that doesn't make
them cry, nothing will.

288
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:11,820
Cry? Why should they cry?

289
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:17,105
Because you're the bravest kid that ever
lived. There's no fake about it this time.

290
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:19,689
Oh, look!

291
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:04,254
Don't excite yourself too much.
It's just a fake.

292
00:26:04,348 --> 00:26:05,181
What did you say?

293
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:07,594
I said, don't excite yourself too much.
It's just a fake.

294
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:10,094
- Who? Who is a fake?
- Those grapplers.

295
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,860
- The only square thing about them is the ring.
- Oh, them!

296
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,298
They're a symbol to the whole town

297
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:17,124
pretending to fight, love,
weep and laugh all the time...

298
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:18,704
and they're phonies, all of 'em.

299
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,870
- And I head the list.
- Oh no, you don't. Don't say that.

300
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:24,401
Using you to get a bonus and
a byline on the front page.

301
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,516
Making good over your poor,
little pain-racked body and all.

302
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:30,415
I'm worse than those fake wrestlers.

303
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:34,027
I feel fine tonight, Wally. You and the
Morning Star have been so wonderful to me.

304
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,986
You know, these wonderful gowns and the
banquets and the theater tickets and...

305
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,073
the poetry.

306
00:26:38,694 --> 00:26:41,027
Stop looking so happy
and gallant, will you?

307
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,073
Breaks my heart.

308
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:16,327
- You all right?
- Oh, yes. I-I feel fine.

309
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:29,131
Ladies and gentlemen! I have just learned
that Miss Hazel Flagg is in the audience!

310
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:45,931
I would like to ask this distinguished
audience to observe ten seconds of silence

311
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:48,747
in respect for Miss Flagg.

312
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:17,915
Okay, boys.

313
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:45,560
Would it interfere with your running the
fleet if I ask you something personal?

314
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:48,521
That's what we're here for,
to get personal. Proceed.

315
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:50,802
There's a loose halyard fore.
Go and make it fast, will you?

316
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:53,382
- That thing on the top there?
- Yes, my little mariner, yes.

317
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:54,686
Try not to go overboard.

318
00:28:55,288 --> 00:28:57,921
I asked several people,
but they didn't know.

319
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,650
- They didn't know what?
- If you were married.

320
00:29:02,514 --> 00:29:04,966
The answer, in capital
letters, is no. N-O.

321
00:29:05,382 --> 00:29:06,382
- N-O?
- Yeah. N-O.

322
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:10,760
Oh, I see. I don't suppose
newspapermen marry, as a rule.

323
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:14,826
Not after they're 14 or 15. That's the
dangerous age for the journalist.

324
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:19,159
His ideals are not yet formed and he
falls easy prey to elderly waitresses.

325
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:23,285
- Once his finer side is born, he waits.
- For what?

326
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:27,228
For the sound of the flare alarm, Miss
Flagg. Waits to go rushing off for the fire.

327
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,931
- What fire is that, Mr. Cook?
- Love.

328
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:33,785
- I used to hear about that in Warsaw.
- Yeah. It's gotten around.

329
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:05,899
- You're having fun?
- Yes. But you know, I get kinda depressed.

330
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:09,056
You know, last night when I entered
the theater, everybody moaned. Oh.

331
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,169
You know, I might as well be
a case of walking cholera.

332
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,171
Don't do that!

333
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:23,580
Now, I used to love New York when
they went gaga over some celebrity.

334
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,547
Danced in the streets with a
neon light around its heart.

335
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:32,787
I'm getting fed up with its trick tears
and phony lamentations over you.

336
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,079
I'm glad they're phony. It makes
everything all right, in a way.

337
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:39,409
I mean I wouldn't wanna feel I was
really making all those people suffer.

338
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:54,625
Wally! Wally, look at
that man with the toupee!

339
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:21,752
Greetings, greetings, my little folks!
Heh-heh.

340
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,058
Tonight, there is one among us

341
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:28,908
Who adds a bit of unaccustomed
drama to our little rally.

342
00:31:29,168 --> 00:31:32,774
She sits here, eyes sparkling, her
face wreathed in a lovely smile.

343
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:39,505
Drinking in the charm, the
glitter, the gay sounds of life.

344
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:44,880
So drink your wine,
laugh and applaud

345
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:49,826
while this little doomed child
sits saying goodbye to you.

346
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:54,039
Her last goodbye, with a
grateful smile on her lips.

347
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:58,446
So on with the show,
my little actors all.

348
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:05,429
On with the show, for tonight you're
not the famous folk of Broadway.

349
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:10,447
Tonight you're just a little chorus
laughing and dancing and pirouetting

350
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:14,237
To afford a last brief
hour of mirth and jollity

351
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:19,173
to America's simplest and sweetest
of heroines

352
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,677
Miss Hazel Flagg.

353
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:35,245
For good, clean fun, there's
nothing like a wake.

354
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,513
Oh please, please,
let's not talk shop.

355
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,697
Our next number tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
is entitled "The Heroines of History".

356
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:58,525
Catherine the Great who saved Russia.
She could do it, too.

357
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:13,436
Lady Godiva who saved her virtue.

358
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,209
That's the way those
things go, folks.

359
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,923
Katinka who saved Holland by
putting her finger in the dyke.

360
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:43,418
Show them the finger, babe.

361
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:59,764
Pocahontas who saved
Captain John Smith

362
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:03,311
and later on set him up in
the cough drop business.

363
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:21,935
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to
meet that little girl from Warsaw, Vermont.

364
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:26,205
That little soldier whose heroic
smile in the face of death

365
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:30,143
has wrung tears and cheers from
the great stone heart of the city.

366
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:38,923
I humbly invite her now to take her place
beside all the great Heroines of History.

367
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:43,568
Our own Miss Hazel Flagg!

368
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,653
Look! Something has
happened to Hazel!

369
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,829
Look out, young fella.
Let me at her.

370
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:10,455
- Has it... has it come?
- Doctor, I wanna know the worst.

371
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,243
I don't want you to spare our feelings.
We're going to press in 15 minutes.

372
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,703
- Is there a chance, doctor?
- I've been expecting something like this.

373
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:26,235
Let's get her out of here.
Quick.

374
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:34,333
Please, everybody. Take your seats.
Quiet, please. Take your seats.

375
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:36,244
There must be no commotion.

376
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:39,248
The show must go on. Hazel
would want it that way.

377
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:49,006
I'm disgusted with you, Hazel. Getting
drunk in the middle of a memorial.

378
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:51,964
- Now lie down like I tell you.
- I'm not drunk.

379
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:57,075
I just had a little sip, thassall, and then...
then all of those buffaloes ran over me.

380
00:36:57,161 --> 00:36:58,994
They weren't buffaloes,
they were horses.

381
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:02,523
- I might've been trampled to death!
- Don't yell, I tell you!

382
00:37:04,217 --> 00:37:08,517
If somebody respectable could see you
now, that would be pretty, wouldn't it?

383
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:09,605
Shame on you!

384
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,510
Take your stockings off!

385
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:14,821
You're the doctor,
take 'em off yourself.

386
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:25,295
Say! What are you doing?

387
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,718
If anything happens,
we have to replate.

388
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,340
That's all that counts to
you, isn't it, you birdbrain

389
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:43,304
With a headline for a heart?

390
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:46,736
That poor, gallant little kid standing in
front of that goofy bunch of horses.

391
00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:48,471
And smiling, just smiling.

392
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,800
Don't waste copy on me, Wallace.

393
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:54,921
Oliver, that's the sweetest, loveliest
kid in there that ever lived.

394
00:37:55,154 --> 00:37:57,421
Yes, you said that
before, Wally.

395
00:37:58,113 --> 00:38:02,113
I'm through. I can't play
pallbearer any longer. I'm resigning.

396
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:05,405
She's all right, gentlemen.
Sleeping like a little baby.

397
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,243
- No! Are you sure?
- Just as if nothing had happened.

398
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:11,503
She'll be fitter than a
fiddle in the morning.

399
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:16,723
In the morning,
ya-da-de-dee, da-daa...

400
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,750
Oh.

401
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:24,729
Oh.

402
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:28,989
- Oh my Gosh! Miss Rafferty, Miss Rafferty!
- Yes?

403
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:32,921
Oh, make them stop ringing that phone.
It'll break my head open.

404
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:37,672
- Hello?
- I don't wanna talk to anybody.

405
00:38:37,741 --> 00:38:42,741
Just a minute. There are twenty little
schoolchildren downstairs to sing for you.

406
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:45,073
Mr. Stone arranged for it yesterday.

407
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:47,302
Oh, it's horrible. I'll go mad!

408
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:53,042
- Send them up.
- You may bring them up, sir.

409
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,869
Oh my Gosh, there's a
sawmill inside my head.

410
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,753
You may leave the
room, Miss Rafferty.

411
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:05,974
I brought you something.

412
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,546
Raw eggs.

413
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:13,055
Just what you need.

414
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,157
Their albumen counteracts
the alcohol.

415
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:25,355
Suck 'em right down.
Settle your stomach.

416
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:27,373
Go on. I got a whole dozen.

417
00:39:28,228 --> 00:39:30,095
Is this the way drunks feel?

418
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:34,379
Hazel, you got what is known
in medicine as a hangover.

419
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:38,370
I've got something worse than that.
I've got a conscience.

420
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:42,508
Keep on sucking that egg, and
your conscience will go away.

421
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:44,843
I'm ruining him.

422
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,199
Let me have your pulse, Hazel.

423
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:54,970
Don't jiggle me. My pulse is all right.
I'm as healthy as an ox. Oh!

424
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,163
Well, stop groaning then!

425
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:58,735
You old fraud, you know
what I'm groaning about!

426
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:02,351
Oh, I wish, I wish I had radium
poisoning or something awful.

427
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:03,965
Then... then I wouldn't ruin him.

428
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:05,576
Who is this you're ruining, Hazel?

429
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:09,887
- Wallace. Mr. Cook.
- Oh, him. Have another egg.

430
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,297
Enoch, listen. He thinks I've helped
him become a great journalist

431
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:16,647
and they're gonna give him a bonus.
Mr. Stone is… a bonus.

432
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:18,821
It's coming out of the
$10,000 they owe me.

433
00:40:18,902 --> 00:40:20,835
If I'm not complaining,
why should he worry?

434
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:24,522
He thinks I've helped him. Helped him.
And it makes him feel bad.

435
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,091
Oh, I can't stand it.

436
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:29,577
You know what'll happen when they find out
I'm a horrible, good-for-nothing fake?

437
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,133
They'll blame him. Everybody! They'll
just burn down the newspaper.

438
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:35,950
And the Mayor, he'll have Wally lynched.
You just wait and see.

439
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,564
Oh, Enoch. Why did you
let me come to New York?

440
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,413
If you were only as
honest as you look.

441
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:48,805
Mr. Cook is here to see Miss Flagg.
Do you feel able to speak to him?

442
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:50,910
All right, tell him to wait.

443
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:00,898
- Tell him to come in!
- Come in!

444
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:10,096
- Hello. Hello, Hazel.
- Hello.

445
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:11,328
Hello, doctor.

446
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,504
It, uh, it won't hurt
her if I visit a while?

447
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:19,243
She's doing very well
for her last few weeks.

448
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:28,145
Gee, I'm glad to hear that, Hazel.
I was, uh... we were worried.

449
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:30,035
Excuse me.

450
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:35,494
I wouldn't have disturbed you, but,
uh, I'm going away and I thought...

451
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:38,338
- I might not see you again until...
- You're going away where?

452
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:40,866
Oh, just to Albany.

453
00:41:42,077 --> 00:41:44,444
- What for?
- Just to see the governor.

454
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:46,555
Wallace, what are you doing
in Albany with the governor?

455
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,256
Now, Hazel, you mustn't
get overwrought.

456
00:41:48,316 --> 00:41:49,849
Well, if it's about me,
I must know about it.

457
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,773
It's, uh, about the
arrangements, Hazel.

458
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:55,929
What arrangements?

459
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,698
For the funeral.

460
00:41:58,003 --> 00:41:59,003
What funeral?

461
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:01,152
Yours.

462
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,367
Oh.

463
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,255
Have I... Have I shocked you?

464
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:09,484
Oh no, oh no. Everybody has
to have a funeral sometime.

465
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,478
Well, but not like
yours, darling.

466
00:42:12,548 --> 00:42:15,081
Gee, I meant to keep
it as a surprise.

467
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:20,035
Oh, it's better this way, your telling
me in advance so I can get used to it.

468
00:42:20,634 --> 00:42:22,314
Oh, I hope it's gonna be a little funeral.

469
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:25,336
Oh, I'm afraid that's way
way impossible, Hazel.

470
00:42:25,437 --> 00:42:29,504
According to the present registration,
there'll be about 30,000 automobiles

471
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:33,364
and a considerable group on foot.
About half a million, I think.

472
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,094
- Oh, my.
- That's not half enough to mourn for you.

473
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:43,666
Oliver thought we could get the
President, but, uh, he's still fishing.

474
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,897
I arranged to have the Symphony
orchestra there instead.

475
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:49,168
Well, if it's all arranged,
why are you going to Albany?

476
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:51,877
Well, uh, I had an idea this morning.

477
00:42:53,678 --> 00:42:56,901
I'm getting the governor to declare a
public holiday for the, uh, occasion.

478
00:42:56,936 --> 00:42:58,736
Oh, like St. Valentine's Day?

479
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,179
I'm glad I told you.

480
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:05,552
Hazel, I want you to know now and
always. I think you're magnificent.

481
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:09,549
Oh please, please, don't say that.
Do you have to go away?

482
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:10,877
Oh, I'll be back by night.

483
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:14,624
And I've got another surprise for
you, but I-I'll not tell you now.

484
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,280
But I've got to hear it.

485
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,963
- Well, I promised you I wouldn't do this.
- You wouldn't do what?

486
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:23,205
Call in any other doctor.

487
00:43:24,594 --> 00:43:28,175
Hazel, I know you have great faith in
Enoch. But I've broken my promise.

488
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:34,577
Dr. Emil Egelhofer is arriving on the
Rex this afternoon. He's from Vienna.

489
00:43:34,734 --> 00:43:37,567
- And I'm bringing him to see you.
- What for?

490
00:43:37,722 --> 00:43:41,322
Hazel, he is the greatest expert
on radium poisoning in the world.

491
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:45,183
I know it's incurable, but when I heard
he was on the Rex I radioed him.

492
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:49,017
There's... there's always an outside
chance. You know, just one in a million.

493
00:43:50,776 --> 00:43:54,443
I'm sorry, I... I've got to run
to get the 10 o'clock plane.

494
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:59,871
Hazel, I-I know it's a long shot, but...
we can hope, hm?

495
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:02,293
Goodbye.

496
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:04,765
Goodbye.

497
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,530
Pardon me.

498
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:17,673
- The little children are here, Hazel.
- What little children?

499
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:19,973
- They've come to sing for you.
- Enoch, this is the end.

500
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:22,453
Don't ask any questions,
just listen to me. We're caught.

501
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:25,151
Dr. Egelhofer's coming here
tonight to expose me and Wally.

502
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:29,293
You've got nothing to fear from any
doctor who comes snoopin' around here.

503
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:31,494
Better have another egg.

504
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:34,518
There's only one way out. There's only
one way to save you and me and Wally.

505
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:37,276
I've got to commit suicide in advance
before that scientist gets to me.

506
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:38,767
- I... I've got to be drowned.

507
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,543
- Awww, suck this egg, I tell you.
- Oh, shut up!

508
00:44:40,563 --> 00:44:43,530
I'll leave a note to the
city thanking everybody.

509
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:46,272
You get rid of the news for the evening,
and then I'll jump into the river.

510
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:49,836
Somebody's bound to see me jumping, and you'll
be waiting in a rowboat to fish me out.

511
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,328
And I'll swim underwater,
and I'll change my name

512
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:56,805
and hide away for the rest of my
life and never, never see him again.

513
00:44:57,853 --> 00:45:00,520
And they'll hold the
funeral without me.

514
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:35,964
Hello, honey. This is Ernest.

515
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:39,969
Honey, what kinda
flowers do you like?

516
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:41,219
Huh?

517
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:44,286
Don't worry, honey, they
all the same price.

518
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,772
I'm gettin' them wholesale.

519
00:46:47,343 --> 00:46:48,610
Be right up, honey.

520
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:22,979
Hello. Get me the Morning Star. Quick.

521
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:25,296
Who committed suicide?

522
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:27,839
Read it to me.

523
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:30,013
Dear New York City, Goodbye.

524
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,827
Remember me as someone
you made very happy.

525
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:39,157
I have enjoyed everything.
There's only one thing left to enjoy.

526
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:44,013
Your river - that smiled
outside of my window.

527
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:49,899
It is easy to die when the
heart is full of gratitude.

528
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,558
Hazel Flagg.

529
00:47:54,684 --> 00:47:57,684
Hello, Oliver. Well, we get our holiday.
The governor has agreed to...

530
00:47:57,696 --> 00:47:58,696
Shut up.

531
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,620
Jumpin' H. Sebastian.
She's double-crossed us.

532
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:05,334
- Who has?
- Miss Flagg.

533
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:08,715
- She's gone over to some other paper?
- She's gone into the river.

534
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:11,718
Listen, you weasel-brain. What
are you trying to tell me?

535
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:14,054
Hazel Flagg has committed suicide.

536
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,760
I don't believe it.

537
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,592
Ernest, your Sultan, has
found her suicide note.

538
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,303
He saw her leave the
hotel five minutes ago.

539
00:48:23,722 --> 00:48:25,055
Give me the Mayor at once.

540
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:27,629
Get the governor. Tell him we
want that holiday tomorrow.

541
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:29,948
You're a fine pair of gravediggers.
You and the governor both.

542
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:32,549
Hello, hello, Mayor? This is
Wallace Cook of the Star calling...

543
00:49:02,252 --> 00:49:04,854
One... two... three...
Enoch!

544
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:10,130
Enoch!

545
00:49:11,578 --> 00:49:12,778
Okay, Hazel, okay!

546
00:49:15,855 --> 00:49:16,855
One...

547
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,157
- Two...
- Hazel!

548
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:20,994
Stop!

549
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:25,878
Stop!

550
00:49:26,217 --> 00:49:27,217
Stop!

551
00:49:28,077 --> 00:49:30,877
You freakin' fool! What the
devil's the matter with you?

552
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,063
What are you trying to do?

553
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:51,004
- Wally! Wally! Are you all right?
- Sure! I'm all right!

554
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,193
But I... But I can't swim.

555
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:56,636
- Wally!
- Give me your hand!

556
00:50:17,637 --> 00:50:19,870
That's a fine, sweet
trick you tried to play.

557
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:23,178
- Well, why didn't you stay in Albany?
- Jumping off a pier like some hothead.

558
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:25,474
- I didn't jump, I was pushed!
- Scaring everybody out of their wits...

559
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:26,777
Stop hollering. I'm-I'm nervous.

560
00:50:26,812 --> 00:50:28,679
Listen, either you give me your word
of honor you won't try that again.

561
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:30,186
Or I'll spank your little...

562
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:32,459
Wallace, don't you think you oughta
notify them that you've located me?

563
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:34,952
You know, it seems unfair to
have 'em dragging the river!

564
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:37,135
Oh, the fresh air will do 'em good.
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

565
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:39,144
What...?

566
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,584
This is as good a place as any.
Get in!

567
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:50,181
Oh, it's awfully cozy, isn't it?
Are you still mad at me?

568
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:51,948
I'm mad at myself.

569
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:55,272
Drooling away to you about the funeral...
That's what drove you to it!

570
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:57,691
To be really frank with you,
Wallace, it wasn't that at all.

571
00:50:58,137 --> 00:51:01,804
Oh, darling, I'd love to sit in here
with you for the rest of my life.

572
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,730
Hazel?

573
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:11,492
Will you marry me?

574
00:51:11,725 --> 00:51:14,792
- What?
- You heard me. Will you marry me?

575
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,427
- Oh, Wally...
- Come on, answer me.

576
00:51:17,902 --> 00:51:19,735
But darling, there's
no future in it.

577
00:51:19,824 --> 00:51:23,224
Now, don't talk like a half-wit.
I don't care about the future.

578
00:51:23,611 --> 00:51:25,131
Oh, Wally, if things
were normal I'd...

579
00:51:25,737 --> 00:51:28,470
Oh, Wally, I... I mustn't.
Don't ask me.

580
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:32,645
Please, just kiss me once more and let
it go at that without ruining your life.

581
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:36,054
So what the devil is there
better to life than we've got?

582
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:39,998
A handful of perfect hours. That's
all the luckiest ever get out of it.

583
00:51:40,504 --> 00:51:43,437
Just a handful of hours
to save and remember.

584
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:50,240
And then... I'll be there at the end,
sailor. I'll be there waving you goodbye.

585
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,370
It'll be the same as if you
and I had lived forever.

586
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:57,195
And you'll... you'll
grow old in my heart.

587
00:51:58,207 --> 00:51:59,307
Okay, Skipper.

588
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:09,786
You seen anyting of a young
lady what yumped in the river?

589
00:52:10,118 --> 00:52:11,151
Yeah. She's... she's right here.

590
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:13,601
All right. Yim, get the bullmotor.

591
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,333
Oh, never mind the bullmotor.
Now, her breathing's fine.

592
00:52:18,904 --> 00:52:23,098
- Just... drive us to her hotel, will you?
- Sure. Yump in.

593
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:35,299
Yumpin' Yiminy.

594
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:42,354
- Oh. Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

595
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,362
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

596
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:50,606
- Ehh... You're welcome.
- Now...

597
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,570
Looks as if I finally get
my ride on a fire engine.

598
00:52:55,618 --> 00:52:58,051
- Yeah.
- Yumpin' Yiminy.

599
00:52:59,705 --> 00:53:01,038
- Uh, Yim?
- Yim.

600
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:02,607
Okay, Yim!

601
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:23,950
Gotta go down and bat out the story.
Oliver's having a cat fit.

602
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:26,482
You know, I've been
misjudging him.

603
00:53:26,716 --> 00:53:31,183
When I told him you were safe and sound, he
choked up and couldn't talk for a minute.

604
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,187
- Oh yes, he's very sweet.
- Yeah.

605
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:36,374
Well, I'll... I'll see
you in the morning.

606
00:53:36,956 --> 00:53:39,856
Have a good sleep. Good night.

607
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:44,564
Yes, it's a big fire. Oh, if
you ever hate me, remember

608
00:53:44,997 --> 00:53:49,230
this... and this... and this...
and this and...

609
00:53:55,758 --> 00:53:57,725
The biggest fire since Rome!

610
00:54:12,736 --> 00:54:15,403
Well, well, well. Hello, Hazel.
Come in.

611
00:54:16,444 --> 00:54:18,053
I was wondering
whatever become of you.

612
00:54:21,072 --> 00:54:23,772
Enoch, who is that man?
Enoch, who is that man?

613
00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:27,443
Oh, he's just a stranger from Europe
who dropped in for a little chat.

614
00:54:27,582 --> 00:54:30,522
We've been discussing medicine,
pro and con. Oh, excuse me.

615
00:54:34,106 --> 00:54:36,406
I want to introduce
you to Hazel Flagg.

616
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:39,369
Mister, uh... What did
you same your name was?

617
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:41,768
Egelhofer. Dr. Emil Egelhofer.

618
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:44,304
Dr. Awfulegger...

619
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:48,499
Seems to me I've heard of
you somewhere, doctor.

620
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:51,051
Oh, Enoch... Enoch,
sit down now.

621
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:55,173
I received a radio on the ship
from the Morning Star, Miss Flagg,

622
00:54:55,305 --> 00:54:58,872
Which excited my professional
as well as humane interests.

623
00:54:59,023 --> 00:55:00,890
And I called on you at once.

624
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:05,647
Aaah, that must be my colleagues.

625
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:08,382
Come right in, gentlemen.

626
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,083
This is the young lady,
Miss Hazel Flagg.

627
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,924
Dr. Oswald Vunch of Prague.

628
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:22,495
Dr. Felix Maratchovsky of Moscow.

629
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:27,312
Dr. Friedrich Kirchenweisser of Berlin.

630
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:31,922
All the darkeys am a weeping

631
00:55:35,048 --> 00:55:41,048
Massa's in the cold, cold ground...

632
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:46,590
There is no vestige, no
trace, no single symptom

633
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:49,789
Of radium poising in this
young woman, Mr. Stone.

634
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:54,023
We had some trouble with that
horse doctor from Vermont

635
00:55:56,109 --> 00:55:59,076
But we took the
X-rays regardless.

636
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:03,156
Are you sure you examined
the right woman

637
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:06,751
And not some... some impostor?

638
00:56:06,974 --> 00:56:10,609
Oh, ho-ho. The only impostor in this case,
Mr. Stone, is this young woman we examined.

639
00:56:13,632 --> 00:56:15,865
The young woman who is
known as Hazel Flagg.

640
00:56:18,944 --> 00:56:23,044
Here's the full report of this examination.
Here's the X-ray pictures

641
00:56:23,395 --> 00:56:27,528
showing the entire skeleton of this
young woman known as Hazel Flagg.

642
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,188
And here, Mr. Stone, is my bill.

643
00:56:32,715 --> 00:56:33,982
Um, um... our bill.

644
00:56:35,665 --> 00:56:39,632
And I will assure you,
not me or my colleagues

645
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:43,329
will say one single word
of this to the newspapers.

646
00:56:50,936 --> 00:56:54,036
Goodbye. You have nothing more
to worry about, Mr. Stone.

647
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,163
Your troubles are over.

648
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,879
Send me up four sluggers from
the Circulation Department.

649
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:20,651
Got a bulletin and new lead
for you on Hazel Flagg

650
00:57:20,663 --> 00:57:23,896
that's going to wreathe that sourpuss
of yours into a nosegay of smiles.

651
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:27,107
Now sit tight and
tuck in your ears.

652
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:30,007
Miss Flagg is getting
married tonight.

653
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,473
And wish me luck,
old weasel-brain.

654
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:37,191
Aw, listen, I know
it sounds hysterical

655
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:39,615
marrying somebody with
a few weeks to live.

656
00:57:40,104 --> 00:57:42,465
Like honeymooning with a
hearse at the front door.

657
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:46,044
But, Oliver, it's on the square.

658
00:57:50,586 --> 00:57:51,786
What's the matter with you?

659
00:57:52,493 --> 00:57:54,893
Listen, I want you to be best man...

660
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:59,541
Are you stewed or something?
I came in for congratulations.

661
00:58:00,588 --> 00:58:01,821
What's up? What's eating you?

662
00:58:03,224 --> 00:58:07,212
I am sitting here, Mr. Cook,
trying to figure some way

663
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:13,511
Out of the blackest disaster that has
ever struck down an innocent man

664
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:16,535
since the days of
Judas Ischariot.

665
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:19,466
What are you mumbling about?
What disaster?

666
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:23,028
I am sitting here, Mr.
Cook, toying with the idea

667
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:28,647
of removing your heart -
and stuffing it like an olive!

668
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:32,204
Hang on, Oliver, you're going screwy.
I'll get Watson.

669
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,209
You ruined me.
You ruined the Morning Star.

670
00:58:35,656 --> 00:58:38,656
You blackened forever the
fair name of journalism.

671
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:42,342
You and that foul botch
of nature, Hazel Flagg!

672
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:46,458
You got some excuse for those words,
Oliver. Let's have it. Quick.

673
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:48,304
Excuse?! Excuse?!!!
Look at that!

674
00:58:50,729 --> 00:58:52,396
L-l-l-look at that skeleton!

675
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:56,416
Not a bone missing, down to the
last healthy vertebra! Intact!

676
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:01,302
Read that. Rub your nose in it.
That's Hazel Flagg.

677
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,264
The biggest fake of the century.

678
00:59:03,308 --> 00:59:06,534
A lying, faking witch with the soul of
an eel and the brain of a tarantula.

679
00:59:08,438 --> 00:59:10,705
She hasn't got anything
wrong with her at all.

680
00:59:11,555 --> 00:59:13,555
Sweet heaven, I can't believe it.

681
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:15,694
It's like some miracle.

682
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,593
Get me the Waldorf Hotel
as quick as you can!

683
00:59:18,631 --> 00:59:20,331
Grab Hazel Flagg and
bring her to this office!

684
00:59:20,397 --> 00:59:22,464
If you have to drag her through
the street by the hair!

685
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,973
So help me, Oliver, if you hurt that kid,
I'll knock you cold. I'll brain you!

686
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:28,186
You stay here and watch that maniac.
Watch every move he makes.

687
00:59:28,404 --> 00:59:30,636
I want Hazel Flagg in this
office within half an hour!

688
00:59:32,538 --> 00:59:34,838
- You're staying here!
- Now, Oliver, you're not gonna hurt her...

689
00:59:34,891 --> 00:59:36,191
- Shut up!
- I'm marrying her.

690
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,517
Get that into that
monkey skull of yours.

691
00:59:38,544 --> 00:59:40,444
I don't care how we've been taken or
what she's done. I'm in love with her…

692
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:42,967
- Oh, that's a beautiful thought.
- And I thank God on my knees...

693
00:59:42,974 --> 00:59:45,141
...that she's a fraud and a
fake and isn't going to die.

694
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:48,819
You're on your knees thanking God when the
whole town's getting ready to laugh at us.

695
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,822
A howl that'll be heard
around the world!

696
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,620
Let 'em laugh. I'll do
my own laughing back.

697
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:56,017
- It'll be worse than the French Revolution.
- Well, I hope I'm here when it breaks.

698
00:59:57,035 --> 01:00:00,529
I wanna make one speech to our dear readers
before they carry our heads off on a pike.

699
01:00:00,574 --> 01:00:02,974
Wanna tell 'em we've
been their benefactors.

700
01:00:03,195 --> 01:00:05,562
We gave 'em a chance to pretend
that their phony hearts

701
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:08,034
were dripping with the milk of
human kindness.

702
01:00:09,474 --> 01:00:10,962
- What's your name?
- Who, me? Max.

703
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:17,342
I want quiet in this office, Max.
Quiet so I can think…

704
01:00:18,006 --> 01:00:19,884
- Hazel Flagg's a fraud, eh?
- Gag him!

705
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:23,804
So when you start yelling "foul", remember
she was just a circulation stunt for you.

706
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:26,846
You used her like you've used every broken
heart that's fallen into your knap-sack.

707
01:00:26,944 --> 01:00:29,544
To inflame the daffy public
and help sell your papers.

708
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,027
That's enough about
sellin' papers!

709
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:49,283
Before I finish with that female
Dracula, she'll know one thing -

710
01:00:49,287 --> 01:00:53,420
that Oliver Stone is worse than radium
poisoning four ways from the Jack!

711
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:59,960
Hello? Hello? Who? Moe? Moe who?

712
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,325
Who's Moe Levinsky?

713
01:01:03,517 --> 01:01:06,717
That's my brother. You sent him
over to get that girl. Remember?

714
01:01:06,736 --> 01:01:09,871
Oh, Moe. Listen. What? What's that?

715
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:14,461
Well, what are you stalling for? Get her
back here to the office as I ordered.

716
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:17,275
Get the mush out of your
mouth, man, and speak up!

717
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,750
He's a dumb cluck, Mr. Stone.
You better let me talk to him.

718
01:01:20,872 --> 01:01:23,839
You'll just get him excited...
then he's gone.

719
01:01:24,592 --> 01:01:28,018
Hello, Moe? This is Max.
What's on your mind?

720
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:35,156
Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
Tsk. That's a shame.

721
01:01:35,218 --> 01:01:37,351
- What is it?
- I'm gettin' it.

722
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:40,076
Go on, Moe. And take it easy.

723
01:01:41,222 --> 01:01:43,983
Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
You don't say.

724
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:50,408
Look, Moe. Hold the wire, will you?
I'll take it up with Mr. Stone.

725
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:51,599
Well?

726
01:01:51,695 --> 01:01:54,928
He wants to know where he can get a doctor.
This girl is sick.

727
01:01:54,984 --> 01:01:57,551
- Who's sick?
- This girl. Hazel Flagg.

728
01:01:57,632 --> 01:01:58,532
It's a lie!

729
01:01:58,622 --> 01:02:00,955
Listen, Max, ask him
what she's sick with.

730
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:04,166
He told me. He said it's
something like the DTs.

731
01:02:04,427 --> 01:02:05,927
Only the dope can't
pronounce it.

732
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:08,220
- Well, is the nurse there?
- Just a minute.

733
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:11,784
Hello, M- ... Hello, Moe?
This is Max.

734
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:14,475
Your brother, Max!

735
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:16,841
He's gettin' rattled.

736
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:20,388
Now, don't fly off the handle, Moe. All
I wanna know - is the noisse there?

737
01:02:22,785 --> 01:02:26,752
No, not a noise. A noisse!
Like a tootsie!

738
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:28,522
Thaaat's right.

739
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,897
- Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
- Give me that phone.

740
01:02:33,343 --> 01:02:36,076
- I'm gettin' there...
- Give me that phone, I tell you!

741
01:02:37,347 --> 01:02:39,880
- Here's the noisse.
- Miss Rafferty?

742
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:41,155
Oliver Stone.

743
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:44,187
Pneumonia?
It's a lie, I tell you.

744
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:47,113
Temperature of 106?
Dying?

745
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:51,466
Go back and take her temperature again. I
don't trust that girl until I get a doctor.

746
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:53,619
No, not Dr. Downer!

747
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:57,861
Tell Moe to throw that Vermont quack out
of the room the minute he shows his face.

748
01:02:57,928 --> 01:02:58,928
Get me Moe.

749
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:02,339
Pneumonia? It's the finger
of God if it's true.

750
01:03:03,374 --> 01:03:07,018
Listen, Moe. Don't let anybody
leave that room until I get there.

751
01:03:07,154 --> 01:03:09,954
Dead or alive, nobody
leaves that room. Get me?

752
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:14,373
It's like a pardon from the gallows.
But I'm trusting nobody this time.

753
01:03:14,468 --> 01:03:15,868
I'm taking no chances.

754
01:03:16,286 --> 01:03:20,319
Hello? Hello? Get me
Dr. Emil Egelhofer of Vienna.

755
01:03:20,695 --> 01:03:23,362
Wherever he is.
Well, try all the hotels.

756
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:27,557
Listen, Oliver. I'm going over there.
And if you try to stop me

757
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:30,030
So help me, I'll get you,
if it takes all my life.

758
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,372
Nobody is going to stop you now.

759
01:03:31,468 --> 01:03:34,201
If that little girl is sick,
your place is by her side.

760
01:03:35,368 --> 01:03:38,535
Yes. Dr. Emil Egelhofer of Vienna.

761
01:03:39,164 --> 01:03:41,231
Well, try the medical center.

762
01:03:41,908 --> 01:03:43,708
Try Schulz's Beer Garden!

763
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,926
No, I don't want to see the Mayor.
Take the Mayor away from me.

764
01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:56,546
I want Wallace. Wallace, where are you?

765
01:03:57,073 --> 01:03:59,406
Cut out the shenanigans, will you?
We haven't got any time to lose.

766
01:03:59,512 --> 01:04:03,012
Oh. Wally. Wally, I'm on fire.
Wally...

767
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:04,771
Now, shut up for a minute
and listen to me.

768
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:07,322
Egelhofer is gonna be here
in ten or fifteen minutes.

769
01:04:07,382 --> 01:04:08,382
- Egelhofer.

770
01:04:09,102 --> 01:04:11,335
Dr. Emil Egelhofer of Vienna.

771
01:04:13,326 --> 01:04:15,993
- I knew you were faking the minute I…
- Oh, Wally, they were gonna arrest me.

772
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:19,684
I couldn't get away. I put the thermometer
under the hot water and threw a fit.

773
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:24,137
Oh, Wally, you hate me. I knew you'd
hate me. I told you, I told you...

774
01:04:24,186 --> 01:04:25,886
Let's not go into that now.

775
01:04:25,983 --> 01:04:28,800
Oh, Egelhofer, he'll expose me
again, and there's four of them.

776
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:32,152
- Keep your head and listen to me.
- You hate me.

777
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:35,424
- Now shut up. Where's the hot water?
- It's in there.

778
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,072
As if I didn't know...

779
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,484
- Have you got two thermometers?
- Three. I've got three.

780
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:42,926
- Two are enough.

781
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:45,630
You'll never forgive me for
what I've done to you.

782
01:04:45,669 --> 01:04:48,936
Wally, I wanna die. Honest, I
don't wanna live another minute.

783
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:51,637
Must've been a lot of fun playing
me for the world's prize chump.

784
01:04:51,714 --> 01:04:53,274
- Where's the other thermometer?
- Here.

785
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:57,016
Wallace Cook, king of the boobs. The
only genuine horse's neck on the market.

786
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:58,459
I didn't mean it. Really, I didn't...

787
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,850
All right, shut up and listen to the greatest
sucker in Christendom, and listen hard.

788
01:05:02,248 --> 01:05:04,215
- Egelhofer is coming.
- With his gang?

789
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:05,204
What gang?

790
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:08,601
Well, he's got a wagonload of scientists with
him, with microscopes and searchlights...

791
01:05:08,644 --> 01:05:11,123
- Oh, I'm sunk. I give up.
- Get out of bed.

792
01:05:12,128 --> 01:05:15,395
No, no. Let them arrest
me and put me in prison.

793
01:05:15,564 --> 01:05:18,064
Well, you won't hate me so
much if I'm behind bars.

794
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,314
Listen, my dying swan. This
is no time to stop faking.

795
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:23,601
You're gonna have pneumonia, and
you're gonna have it good.

796
01:05:23,724 --> 01:05:25,957
Why, you want me to stand in front
of the window and catch cold?

797
01:05:26,014 --> 01:05:27,547
No, that would take too long.

798
01:05:28,663 --> 01:05:32,863
We gotta raise your pulse to 160. Quick.
We gotta have you a-gasping, panting

799
01:05:32,955 --> 01:05:35,022
and covered with a cold sweat
inside of five minutes.

800
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:37,663
- How?
- How? I don't... Fight. Fight!

801
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:40,638
Come on. Come on, Delilah,
up with your dukes.

802
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:44,092
Oh, I can't. I'm sick
of faking and lying.

803
01:05:44,298 --> 01:05:45,978
Take that ice pack off
your head and fight.

804
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:49,425
No, no, what's the use?
Why fool them any longer?

805
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:51,786
Because I love you.

806
01:05:53,113 --> 01:05:54,580
Because I'm going to marry you.

807
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:56,721
And I don't wanna spend my
honeymoon hanging around Sing-Sing

808
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,866
blowing kisses to you
in the exercise yard!

809
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:01,907
Come on, stop dogging it. You've
got to be bathed in perspiration!

810
01:06:02,866 --> 01:06:06,133
- Come on, get going, you little crook!
- Who's a crook?!

811
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,071
You and your crooked
newspapermen...

812
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:11,441
That's my baby! Come on, keep
moving, snake brains. Come on.

813
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,102
I'll kill you! Dragging me around like
I was a prize pig with a blue ribbon!

814
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:20,446
There's no blue ribbons on you, baby.
Just a big yellow sign marked "fake".

815
01:06:21,322 --> 01:06:25,555
I'm a fake, huh? I'm a fake? What are you?
And that phony Santa Claus, Oliver Stone?

816
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:28,947
Slobbering and drooling all over me...
That's for the Heroines of History!

817
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:30,579
Mh-hm. And that's
for your Aunt Mary!

818
01:06:31,296 --> 01:06:32,663
Come on. Keep moving,
my little fraud.

819
01:06:32,751 --> 01:06:36,684
I'm not gonna forgive you as long as I live!
I'll just hate you, I'll just hate you...

820
01:06:38,379 --> 01:06:40,479
Let go of me! Let go of me!

821
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,375
Oh, I hate you!

822
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:47,255
You're gonna have plenty
of reason to hate me.

823
01:06:47,422 --> 01:06:50,289
I'm gonna show you cards and spades
in lying for the next fifty years.

824
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:51,816
I'm gonna pay you back for
every lie you told.

825
01:06:51,861 --> 01:06:55,228
I'm gonna flirt and lie and cheat and swindle
right through to our Golden Wedding.

826
01:06:55,296 --> 01:06:57,496
- Yeah, yeah. Let me hit you just once.
- All right. Come on.

827
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:02,138
Yep. That's it. Come on, keep coming.
Faster. Faster. Come on.

828
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:06,489
Keep coming. Faster. Faster. That's it.
Keep swinging. That's the girl. That's it.

829
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:10,632
- What's the matter? Come on.
- Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

830
01:07:10,723 --> 01:07:14,523
Well, that's fine. That's fine. Now
listen to me, and listen carefully.

831
01:07:14,643 --> 01:07:17,077
When you come to, I want you
to remember what I'm saying.

832
01:07:17,123 --> 01:07:20,023
- What do you mean, come to?
- I mean, when you regain consciousness.

833
01:07:20,115 --> 01:07:23,282
I want you to switch thermometers. Put
the hot one in your mouth, you get me?

834
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:25,654
Yeah, yeah. Let me
sock you just once.

835
01:07:25,803 --> 01:07:28,870
Just once on the jaw, and
I don't care what happens.

836
01:07:28,893 --> 01:07:29,893
All right. Come on.

837
01:07:30,669 --> 01:07:33,436
I just heard the elevator door. They're
coming. Don't forget about the thermometer.

838
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:36,148
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right. Say good night to Papa now.

839
01:07:36,841 --> 01:07:38,441
Why? What are you gonna do?

840
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:14,389
You put up a nice fight, Wally.

841
01:08:18,952 --> 01:08:20,719
You mean to say you
saw the whole thing?

842
01:08:20,808 --> 01:08:22,941
From the beginning, Mr. Cook.

843
01:08:23,022 --> 01:08:25,455
You mean to say you stood there and
let me beat up a defenseless woman?

844
01:08:25,525 --> 01:08:28,258
- I did, Mr. Cook.
- Where's your sense of chivalry?

845
01:08:28,273 --> 01:08:32,640
My chivalry? Aren't you just a trifle
confused, Mr. Cook? You hit her!

846
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,213
That's entirely different. I love her!

847
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:54,858
Water. Water! I'm on fire!
I'm hot as a coal...

848
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:58,152
Well, you can cool off now, Hazel.
The jig is up.

849
01:08:58,389 --> 01:08:59,389
What? What?!

850
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:01,135
The jig is up!

851
01:09:02,522 --> 01:09:05,655
You mean to say the whole thing was...
was for... was for nothing?

852
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:06,707
Yeah, I'm sorry...

853
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:08,560
You thought you could put one
over on Oliver Stone, eh?

854
01:09:08,622 --> 01:09:11,342
- Well, I guess I still know a fake when I...
- You keep out of this!

855
01:09:13,156 --> 01:09:14,756
- Wally...
- Yes, dear?

856
01:09:24,282 --> 01:09:28,257
Oh, Wally. I didn't mean to do it, I didn't
mean to do it. I love you, I love you...

857
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,306
Miss Flagg, I wonder if you're aware of
the traditions of a great newspaper.

858
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:41,597
Do you realize what it means to those who
carry aloft the torch of journalism?

859
01:09:42,064 --> 01:09:44,464
From the highest editor
to the lowest office boy

860
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:47,242
the life-blood of a newspaper,
Miss Flagg, is its integrity.

861
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:49,509
Am I right, Wally?

862
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:50,632
Word for word.

863
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:54,390
I wrote that speech for
you ten years ago

864
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,019
At the Cleveland
convention, you remember?

865
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:59,942
You can both talk all you want.
I've made up my mind.

866
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:01,576
Your what?

867
01:10:01,633 --> 01:10:03,733
- I'm through.
- What do you mean, you're through?

868
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:06,629
I'm gonna confess. I'm going back
to Warsaw. They love me there.

869
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:09,050
They don't hit me on the jaw
and push me in rivers...

870
01:10:09,156 --> 01:10:10,656
But you can't confess.

871
01:10:10,923 --> 01:10:14,356
Do you realize that out there are some of
the most important citizens of this town?

872
01:10:14,362 --> 01:10:17,929
All of those people are out there by
special invitation from the Morning Star.

873
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:21,050
And why? To pass on to the people of
New York, to the people of the world

874
01:10:23,547 --> 01:10:25,114
your last words.

875
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:28,975
- For instance?
- Ah, this is no time for sarcasm, Wally.

876
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:31,967
You got me into this, you get me out.
Use your brain.

877
01:10:32,051 --> 01:10:33,051
Mine's stunned.

878
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:37,105
Where's Dr. Downer? Where's
that weasel-hearted medico?

879
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:38,779
He's been on a toot.

880
01:10:39,054 --> 01:10:41,854
We could use him. We could
throw him to the wolves.

881
01:10:42,077 --> 01:10:44,544
Just when we need
him, he isn't here.

882
01:10:46,441 --> 01:10:50,741
I got an idea. We can bury her.
Like they do in India.

883
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:55,115
You know, like the Yogis. We can stick
a tube down for her to breathe through

884
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,973
and dig her up in the
morning with no harm done.

885
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:01,647
- Nothing doing ...!
- Wally! Stop her! Stop her!

886
01:11:03,598 --> 01:11:05,531
- I'm a... I'm a...
- Stop her!

887
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,040
I'm a fake, I'm a phony, I'm not gonna die.
I was never gonna die.

888
01:11:10,082 --> 01:11:12,582
I never had radium poisoning,
I never had anything.

889
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,288
I wanted a trip to New
York, and I got it.

890
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:16,269
And what's more, you and
New York can go... fine!

891
01:11:17,961 --> 01:11:20,853
- Mr. Stone, is this true?
- Uh... uh... yes.

892
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:28,991
Well, this is terrible. Terrible. I
endorsed this thing. I sponsored this girl.

893
01:11:29,087 --> 01:11:30,454
I gave her the key to the city.

894
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:33,045
And just as an election was coming up.

895
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,017
Here's your key. I won't
be needing it anymore.

896
01:11:39,381 --> 01:11:42,381
Miss Flagg, I represent
100,000 young matrons.

897
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:46,676
We switched a whole study course
from "The Menace of Communism"

898
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:48,567
to "The Inspiration of Hazel Flagg".

899
01:11:48,647 --> 01:11:52,010
Miss Flagg. The Girlfriends of the Forest
have just organized a Hazel Flagg Unit

900
01:11:53,388 --> 01:11:57,055
With me as Chief Ranger.
Already, we are 4,000 members.

901
01:11:57,409 --> 01:12:01,542
If you persist in flaunting your
recovery in this flagrant manner

902
01:12:02,722 --> 01:12:04,907
The trees of America will
be without girlfriends.

903
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:14,802
Ladies and gentlemen, the Morning
Star keeps faith with its readers.

904
01:12:15,751 --> 01:12:18,251
This thing must not get out.

905
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,660
Oh, let me alone. I wish
I really could die...

906
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:23,792
Go someplace by myself and...
and die alone!

907
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,164
Like an elephant!

908
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:29,418
Happy, Mr. Cook?

909
01:13:31,952 --> 01:13:32,952
Ecstatic, Mrs. Cook.

910
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:47,167
I know what you're gonna say.
You think I'm Hazel Flagg.

911
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:51,173
Well, I'm getting sick and tired of
people mistaking me for that fake!

912
01:13:52,477 --> 01:13:55,359
Fake? Young woman, how dare you
speak of Hazel Flagg as a fake?

913
01:13:55,472 --> 01:14:00,072
How dare you slur the memory of one of
the most gallant girls that ever lived?

914
01:14:01,093 --> 01:14:04,593
Despite you and your kind the world
will never forget Hazel Flagg.

915
01:14:06,965 --> 01:14:08,698
That's what I'm afraid of.

916
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:12,976
Don't worry, baby. Two months from now,
they won't know who Hazel Flagg was.

917
01:14:12,986 --> 01:14:14,486
They'll find another elephant.

918
01:14:14,549 --> 01:14:17,449
Darling, you're forgetting that everybody
in New York knew me and loved me.

919
01:14:17,508 --> 01:14:20,175
Loved me for my courage,
my brave smile in the face of...

920
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:22,737
Well, after all, I was a
pretty important person.

921
01:14:22,762 --> 01:14:24,828
Just a flash in the pan of Manhattan.

922
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,450
And they were beginning
to get pretty impatient

923
01:14:27,489 --> 01:14:29,156
at the way you were
dragging the thing out.

924
01:14:29,334 --> 01:14:30,534
That's a lie, and you know it.

925
01:14:30,617 --> 01:14:33,450
Why, right now, millions of people
are crying just thinking about me.

926
01:14:33,742 --> 01:14:35,382
Why don't you get wise
to yourself, Hazel?

927
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:38,859
You're just another freak, like the
Bearded Lady, Jo-Jo the Dog-face...

928
01:14:38,924 --> 01:14:41,057
- Take that back, or I'll...
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

929
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:42,290
Hazel! Hazel!

930
01:14:43,581 --> 01:14:45,214
Yes, Enoch. What is it?

931
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,153
Hazel!

932
01:14:48,892 --> 01:14:49,892
Hazel!

933
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:55,601
Run for your life!
Run for your life!

934
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:59,405
The whole town is flooded!
Flooded...

935
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:01,429

1
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:42,534
<i>Thrice happy he who hides
from pomp and power</i>

2
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:46,237
<i>in sylvan shade
or solitary bower</i>

3
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:50,281
<i>where balmy zephyrs
fan his burning cheeks...</i>

4
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:54,114
- Clown! The king of clowns!
Leave the stage at once!

5
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,277
Who is it?

6
00:02:57,307 --> 00:03:00,230
It's Cyrano.
I was afraid he'd do this.

7
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,913
<i>Thrice happy he
who hides from pomp and power...</i>

8
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:07,576
- Wretch! Did I not forbid
you to appear this month?

9
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:11,930
- Let's be quiet.
- Quiet!

10
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,052
Go on Montfleury.

11
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:19,076
<i>Thrice happy he who...</i>

12
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:20,307
He who, indeed.

13
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:23,410
Donkeys say rather Hee-Haw!

14
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:30,476
Begone! Or must I come and
help you off the stage myself?

15
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:36,692
What! Still there?

16
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,915
Where balmy zephyrs
fan his burning cheeks...

17
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:44,749
Fat swine, if you dare breathe
on balmy zephyr more

18
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,341
I'll fan your cheeks
for you!

19
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:49,182
Monsieur, won't you all
protect me?

20
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:50,794
- Proceed, proceed.
- Go on.

21
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:53,586
Sir, I will not allow you
to insult me in this manner.

22
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,229
Really?
What manner would you prefer?

23
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,560
Quiet, down there!

24
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,652
- We'll tolerate
no more of this.

25
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:02,434
Go on with the play,
Montfleury.

26
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:07,198
Unless these gentlemen
retain your seats

27
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:09,510
my sword may
bite their ribbons.

28
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,372
Who is this braggart?

29
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,794
My cousin, sir.

30
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,437
Well, Montfleury,
still no exit?

31
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:19,659
- Very well then,
I enter

32
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,473
with knife, to carve
this fat, stuffed goose.

33
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,913
I pray, do not crowd
my scabbard here.

34
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:37,064
She may put her
tongue out at you.

35
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:43,740
Silence.

36
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,583
I say be silent!

37
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,017
And I offer one universal
challenge to you all:

38
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:54,169
Will all who wish to die,
please raise their hands.

39
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,122
Approach, young heroes.
I will take your names.

40
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:00,595
To the first man who falls
I'll build a monument.

41
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,477
Who will head the list?

42
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:03,548
You, sir?

43
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:05,469
No.

44
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:06,380
You?

45
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:07,941
No, no.

46
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:09,543
Anyone?

47
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,375
Anyone at all?

48
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,329
Not one...name?

49
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,201
Not one finger?

50
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:23,045
Very well then,
I go on.

51
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,602
Attend to me, Full Moon.

52
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,987
I clap my hands three times, thus.

53
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:43,122
At the third, you will...
eclipse yourself.

54
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,193
Ready!

55
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:45,715
One.

56
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:48,877
How dare you.

57
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:50,018
I demand!

58
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:50,879
I insist.

59
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,961
- I call upon all the nobles...
- Two!

60
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:55,903
This is an outrage.

61
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:56,854
You hear, an outrage.

62
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:59,437
Nothing on earth
will move me from this stage.

63
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:01,618
Three!

64
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:12,038
Fair ladies and noble gentlemen...
- Boo!

65
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,042
But, Monsieur de Bergerac,

66
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:20,325
why have you done this
to our Montfleury, an admirable actor?

67
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,927
I have two reasons,
either one conclusive.

68
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,640
First, he is an
abominable actor,

69
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,712
who mouths his verse
and moans his tragedy.

70
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:30,474
Second,...

71
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:33,817
Well, that's my secret.

72
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:38,130
But...
But you've closed the play!

73
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,732
It is not a very good play.

74
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:41,824
Huh!
And of their money?

75
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:43,936
Possibly you would like
that returned to these good people.

76
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:44,816
Yes?

77
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:46,218
Yes.

78
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,690
Here,...catch!

79
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:54,825
Well, Monsieur, you are hereby
authorized to close our play every night.

80
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,066
On these terms.

81
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,269
Ladies and gentlemen,
your money will be returned.

82
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:01,121
Kindly pass out, quietly.

83
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,902
Goodnight, goodnight.

84
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,493
Your cousin is an
extraordinary man, Madame.

85
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,964
Oh, I agree.

86
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:21,438
Soldier, poet, philosopher,
musician, playwright.

87
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:22,459
All those?

88
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:26,253
Yes, and the best
swordsman in Paris.

89
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:27,203
Really?

90
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,956
Now, I should have thought
the Vicomte here had that honor.

91
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:34,260
Tell me, Madame, that
comic mask, that nose,

92
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,201
presently he will take it off?

93
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:38,854
No, Monsieur, he keeps it.

94
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:42,257
And heaven help
the man who smiles.

95
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:43,968
Good night.

96
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,794
Oh, Monsieur!

97
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:52,896
Monsieur!

98
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:55,628
Uh, when do you leave Paris?

99
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,020
Sir?

100
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,201
Why, after what you've
just done to Montfleury,

101
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,674
did you not know that
the Compte de Guiche was his patron?

102
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:03,115
Who's yours?

103
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:05,067
No one.

104
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:05,867
No one?

105
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:06,798
No patron?

106
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:07,559
I said not.

107
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,831
But the Compte de Guiche
has a long arm.

108
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:11,833
Mine is longer
by three feet of steel.

109
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:13,114
Yes, but.

110
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,095
but, what a scare...

111
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:15,926
You may go now.

112
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:17,447
- but...
- You may go.

113
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,561
Well, tell me,
why are you staring at my nose?

114
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,102
Oh, I was not staring.

115
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:24,574
Does it astonish you?

116
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,866
Why n...Why no, I've been careful
not to look.

117
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,457
Oh, and why not, if you please?

118
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:29,678
It disgusts you, then?

119
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,829
But, no, I just...

120
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,651
Does its color appear
to you unwholesome?

121
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:33,431
By no means.

122
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,263
Then, possibly you find it
just a trifle large?

123
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,455
No, small, very small, tiny!

124
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:38,596
Infinitesimal!

125
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:41,919
What?
You accuse me of absurdity?

126
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,692
Small, my nose?
Why magnificent, my nose!

127
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,864
You pug, you knob,
you button head,

128
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,136
know that I glory
in this nose of mine!

129
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,368
For a great nose
indicates a great man,

130
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:58,413
congenial, courteous,
intellectual, virile, courageous.

131
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,026
Whilst that face of yours,

132
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:07,051
that blank, inglorious concavity
which my right hand finds on top of you,

133
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:12,616
is as devoid of pride, of poetry,
of soul, of picturesqueness,

134
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:17,800
of contour, of character,
of nose, in short,

135
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,735
As that which is at the bottom of that limp,
spine of yours my left foot.- Oh, help!

136
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,838
Presently, this fellow
will grow tiresome.

137
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:29,591
Oh, he blows his horn.

138
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,803
- Well, will no one
put him in his place?

139
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,666
If you would all me.
Observe.

140
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:44,273
Monsieur, your nose,
your nose is rather large.

141
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:48,417
Rather?

142
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:49,368
Oh, well.

143
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:50,639
Is that all?

144
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:51,560
Well, of course, you...

145
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,421
Ah, no young sir, you're too simple.

146
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,643
Why, you might have
said a great many things.

147
00:09:55,673 --> 00:09:57,825
Why waste your opportunity?

148
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:58,886
For example, thus...

149
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:00,478
Aggressive-

150
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:04,071
I, sir, if that great nose were mine,
I would have it amputated on the spot.

151
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,742
Practical-

152
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,606
How do you drink with such a nose.
You must have had a cup made especially.

153
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:10,917
Descriptive-

154
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:13,609
'Tis a rock, a crag, a cape.

155
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,554
A cape, say rather, a peninsula.

156
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:20,035
Inquisitive-

157
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:24,449
Uh, what is that receptacle,
a razor case or a portfolio?

158
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,730
Kindly-

159
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,893
Ah, do you love the little birds so much
that when they come and sing to you,

160
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:31,745
you give them this to perch on?

161
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:33,627
Cautious-

162
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:37,180
Take care. A weight like that
might make you top-heavy.

163
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,311
Eloquent-

164
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:42,575
When it blows the typhoon howls
and the clouds darken.

165
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:43,465
Dramatic-

166
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:47,759
When it bleeds...the Red Sea.

167
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,601
Simple-

168
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,713
Eh, when do they
unveil the monument?

169
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:53,975
Military-

170
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:56,587
Beware, a secret weapon!

171
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:58,699
Enterprising-

172
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:01,161
What a sigh for some perfumer!

173
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:02,382
Respectful-

174
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,134
Uh sir, I recognize in you
a man of parts,

175
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,827
a man of...prominence.

176
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:09,588
Or, Literary-

177
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:12,451
Was this the nose
that launched a thousand ships?

178
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,944
These, my dear sir, are things
you might have said had you

179
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,786
some tinge of letters or of wit
to color your discourse.

180
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:21,568
Bit wit not so.
You never had an atom.

181
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:28,084
And of letters, you need
but three to write you down, a..s..s.

182
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,136
Ass.

183
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:31,647
You, sir!

184
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,209
Dolt! Bumpkin! Fool!

185
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:40,235
How do you do, and I,
Cyrano Savinien Hercule de Bergerac.

186
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:41,666
Vicomte, come.

187
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:44,268
Such arrogance.
This scarecrow who...

188
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:45,469
Look at him!

189
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,743
No ribbons. No lace.
Not even gloves!

190
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:53,326
True. I carry my adornments
only on my soul.

191
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,488
Decked with deeds
instead of ribbons.

192
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:57,049
Mantled in my good name,

193
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,981
and crowned with a
white plume of freedom.

194
00:11:59,011 --> 00:11:59,762
But..

195
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,143
But, I have no gloves.

196
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,264
A pity, too.

197
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,267
I had one, the last one of an old pair,
and lost that.

198
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:06,888
Very careless of me.

199
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:09,390
Some gentleman offered me
an impertinence.

200
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,484
I left it in his face.

201
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:14,485
So be it!

202
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:18,698
You shall die exquisitely

203
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:19,809
Oh, a poet.

204
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,291
Oh, yes, a poet if you will.

205
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:25,164
So, uh, while we fight,
I'll improvise a ballad for you,

206
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,927
and as I end the refrain,
...skhrch!...thrust home.

207
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:29,938
Will you?

208
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:31,790
I will.

209
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:40,557
Ballad au Duel
at the Theatre de Burgoyne

210
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,990
between de Bergerac,
and uh...a barbarian.

211
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,912
What do you mean by that?

212
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:46,673
Oh, that?

213
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:48,635
The title.

214
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:51,877
Stop. Let me choose my rhyme.

215
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:01,326
So. Here we go.

216
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,758
Lightly I toss my hat away.

217
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:09,132
Languidly o'er my arm let fall
the cloak that covers my bright array.

218
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:14,467
Then, out swords,
and to work withal.

219
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,421
A Lancelot in his lady's hall,

220
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:24,286
A Spartacus at the Hippodrome,

221
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:27,048
I dally a while with you..

222
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:28,459
you jackall.

223
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,087
Just as I end the refrain,

224
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,109
thrust home!

225
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:07,964
Where shall I skewer my peacock again?

226
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,910
Nay, better for you
to have shunned this brawl.

227
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,763
Here in the heart
or your ribbons, gay,

228
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:20,365
in the belly
'neath you silken shawl?

229
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,894
Now, come my points floats,
light as the foam

230
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:32,405
ready to drive you
back to the wall,

231
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:33,797
and then as I end the refrain,

232
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:35,208
thrust home.

233
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:36,979
Oh, for a rhyme.

234
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,831
Why, your fight is fading.

235
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:39,812
You break.

236
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:40,743
You cower.

237
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:41,674
You cringe.

238
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,674
You crawl.

239
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:44,516
How can I tell
you're allowed to say

240
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:45,527
something to turn on my head

241
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,498
forestall...

242
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:47,439
Life with a tunny

243
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:48,750
death with a scall.

244
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,541
Something to turn on my fancy roam,

245
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:52,453
free for a time till the rhyme's recall,

246
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:54,405
then as I end the refrain,

247
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,406
thrust home!

248
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,458
Refrain.

249
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,752
Prince,
pray God that is Lord of all,

250
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,634
pardon you soul,

251
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,987
for your time has come.

252
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,621
Pass! I fling you aslant, asprawl.

253
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,392
Then as I end the refrain,

254
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:51,515
thrust home!

255
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,315
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, please,

256
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:04,636
not until the performance is over.

257
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:05,827
Close the house.

258
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:06,668
A strike,

259
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,189
but leave the lights.

260
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,921
We rehearse the new
farce tonight.

261
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,096
Wait.

262
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,429
You have only to watch a fight,

263
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,391
or have you ruined
if you listen to them.

264
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,434
Think of the enemies you've made,

265
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:27,917
Montfleury, the Vicomte,
if he lives,

266
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:31,249
all those foppish marquis,
the Comte de Guiche.

267
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,841
That politician.

268
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,783
He's the Cardinal's nephew.
There's power there!

269
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,205
And power here.

270
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,556
Young fool!

271
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,418
Take an example from me.

272
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:43,690
20 years a captain,
while others who know only

273
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,632
how to deploy their
forces at court

274
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,774
now dangle a marshal's baton.

275
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:51,247
Well, uh, someday
I will avenge you, too.

276
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,420
Impossible.
Come on, let's go to dinner.

277
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,721
Dinner?
No, not I.

278
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:56,732
Why not?

279
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:58,423
Because I have no money.

280
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,045
But, the purse of gold.

281
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,036
Farewell paternal pension.

282
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:05,329
And you have
until the first of next month?

283
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,210
Nothing.

284
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,362
What a fool.

285
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,674
Yes, but, what a moment.

286
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:11,575
Pardon, Monsieur.

287
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,678
A man ought
never to go hungry.

288
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,060
I have everything here.

289
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:20,272
Please.

290
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:24,997
My dear child, I cannot bend this Gascon
pride of mine to accept such a kindness.

291
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:25,737
But, I...

292
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,731
Yet, for fear that
I may give you pain if I refuse,

293
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,113
I will take something.

294
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,585
A grape.

295
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:39,089
One only.

296
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:41,101
And a glass of water.

297
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:42,582
No, clear.

298
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:49,688
And, uh,...half a macaroon.

299
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,040
Nothing more?

300
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:53,862
Why, yes.

301
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,174
Your hand to kiss.

302
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,470
Thank you, sir.

303
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,062
Good night.

304
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:24,258
Idiot.

305
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:27,862
Dinner.

306
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:30,134
Drink.

307
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:33,697
Desert.

308
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,651
Mon Dieux, I was hungry,
abominably.

309
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:40,303
Tell me.

310
00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:41,424
Anything.

311
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:43,906
Why to you hate
this Montfleury?

312
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:46,848
A very bad actor.

313
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:48,850
Ah, come now, the real
reason, the truth.

314
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:53,594
That fat goat who cannot hold
his belly in his arms,

315
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:56,587
still dreams of being
sweetly dangerous among the women.

316
00:18:57,227 --> 00:19:01,611
Sighs and languishes, making sheep's
eyes out of his great frog's face.

317
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:06,756
I hate him ever since one day
he dared smile upon...

318
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:13,231
Oh, my friend, I seemed to see over
some flower a great snail crawling.

319
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:15,193
Eh, what?

320
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:17,355
Is it possible?

321
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:20,197
For me to love?

322
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,681
I love.

323
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,593
Whom?
May I know?

324
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,644
Whom I love?

325
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,026
Think a moment.

326
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,307
Think of me.

327
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:34,700
Me, whom the plainest
woman would despise.

328
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,044
Me, with this nose of mine that marches
on before me by a quarter of an hour.

329
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,037
Whom shall I love.

330
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:48,973
Why, of course, it must be the
woman in the world most beautiful.

331
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,215
Most beautiful?

332
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:56,970
In these eyes of mine...
beyond compare.

333
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,121
Wait.

334
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:00,493
Your cousin, Roxane.

335
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:03,355
Yes.

336
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:05,137
Roxane.

337
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:06,868
Well?

338
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,081
Why not?
If you love her, tell her so.

339
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:14,235
My old friend.

340
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:17,618
Look at me and tell me how
much hope remains for me

341
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,039
with this protuberance.

342
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:20,430
Ahhh, I have no more illusions.

343
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:26,215
Now and then I may grow tender
walking alone in the blue of evening

344
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:30,209
through some garden fresh with flowers
after the benediction of the rain.

345
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,013
My poor big devil of a nose
inhales April.

346
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:41,038
And I follow with my eyes where
some boy with a girl upon his arm,

347
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,223
passes a patch of silver...
and I feel somehow...

348
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,587
I wish I had a woman, too,

349
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:55,761
walking with me under the moon,
and holding my arm and smiling.

350
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:58,343
Then I dream.

351
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:00,245
I forget.

352
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:07,321
And then I see the shadow
of my profile on the wall.

353
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,164
My friend.

354
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,346
My friend.

355
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:17,490
I have my bitter days,
knowing myself so ugly, so alone.

356
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,382
Ah, but your wit, your courage,

357
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:22,294
why that poor child who just
now offered you your dinner,

358
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:24,837
your saw it, her eyes
did not avoid you.

359
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:29,050
That is true.

360
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,663
Well, then, Roxane herself,
watching your duel, pale.

361
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:33,614
Pale?

362
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:36,807
Yes, her lips parted.
Her hand at her breast, thus.

363
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:38,158
I saw it.

364
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:41,401
Speak to her. Speak, man.

365
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,700
She might laugh at me.

366
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:56,634
It is the one thing
in this world I fear.

367
00:21:56,675 --> 00:22:00,648
Pardon, Monsieur,
a lady outside asking for you.

368
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,911
Monsieur.

369
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:05,432
A Duenna.

370
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:08,695
I have a message for you
from a...a certain lady.

371
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:11,928
She desires to know when
and where she may see you privately.

372
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:14,240
She has certain
things to tell you.

373
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,021
Certain...

374
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,182
Things!

375
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,895
She wishes to see me?

376
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:22,587
We go tomorrow at dawn
to hear mass at St. Rupe

377
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:25,250
And afterwards, where
would you suggest?

378
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,811
Well, then, I...

379
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:29,483
- Where?
- Well?

380
00:22:29,844 --> 00:22:31,255
Ah...I am thinking.

381
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,266
And you think?

382
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:34,778
Where?

383
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:36,249
The shop at Ragueneau's.

384
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,771
Yes, yes, Ragueneau,
the pastry cook.

385
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:39,592
Who dwells?

386
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:41,784
Rue Saint Honore.

387
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:42,885
Eh...Rue Saint Honore.

388
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:47,729
We are agreed. At 7 o'clock.
Until then. Adieu.

389
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:54,145
I'll be there.

390
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:58,318
Me! To see me!

391
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:00,040
Ah, not quite so gloomy.

392
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,792
After all, she knows
that I exist.

393
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:04,274
Imagine, she has
asked to see me!

394
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:06,456
So, now you're
going to be happy?

395
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,568
Happy. I'm going to be a storm. A flame!

396
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:12,651
I need to fight whole
armies all alone!

397
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:14,062
I have ten hearts!

398
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,504
I have a hundred arms!.

399
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:18,676
I feel too strong
to war with mortals!

400
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,379
BRING ME GIANTS!

401
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,472
Quiet, please, shhh.
We are rehearsing back here.

402
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,837
So sorry.
Ha, ha, ha.

403
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:36,522
Cyrano.

404
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:37,873
Cyrano.

405
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:38,834
Ragueneau.

406
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,157
Oh, thank goodness
you're still here.

407
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:43,428
Well, what's the matter.

408
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,659
I'm afraid to go home.

409
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,490
Why?

410
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,301
You know those
comic verses I wrote?

411
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:49,083
About the congregation.

412
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:51,515
Cyrano, he's hired ruffians.
Bullies.

413
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,997
A hundred, waiting for
me on the way home.

414
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:55,879
They're gonna beat me.
Cane me!

415
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:58,711
Please, would you permit me
to spend the night with you?

416
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:00,683
A hundred men,
is that all?

417
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,876
Ragueneau, you're
going home tonight.

418
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:05,898
But they're armed.
They're cutthroats!

419
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,889
Take this lantern.
Forward march.

420
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:10,031
I say that I'll be the man
to see you to your shop.

421
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,423
Not you, I want no help from you.

422
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,784
For even for a hundred,
you're mad.

423
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,005
Those are the odds I want.

424
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,697
Why for this pastry cook?

425
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:19,099
First, because this
pastry cook is a friend of mine.

426
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,102
Second, because this
pastry cook is also a poet.

427
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:23,643
And, most important,

428
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:26,286
if anything should
happen to this pastry cook,

429
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:31,160
tomorrow morning at seven
his shop will be closed.

430
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:33,882
Goodnight.

431
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,841
Cyrano. Help!

432
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:58,946
Look out behind you!

433
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,211
I have been robbed.

434
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:41,473
There are no hundred here.

435
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:47,769
It's, it's, it's...

436
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,641
Be quick. Inside.

437
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:52,963
Bolt the door!

438
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:04,733
Ah!

439
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:24,100
Yah!

440
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:16,496
Ah!

441
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,049
Awk.

442
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,781
Cyrano!

443
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,821
Hold!

444
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:49,846
Ah.

445
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:52,938
How do you feel?

446
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:55,060
Oh, pleasantly exhilarated.

447
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:58,513
- Come, I know a little tavern not far...
- Where's Ragueneau?

448
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,846
Ragueneau?
Ragueneau!

449
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:05,039
Little boy, come out.
All's well!

450
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,521
- Is it over?
- All over.

451
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:08,552
Really?

452
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:10,874
So soon?

453
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:11,675
Ha, ha, ha.

454
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:15,018
Oh, if only I'd had my sword.
How many did we kill?

455
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:15,868
Oh, about eight.

456
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:16,899
Eight.

457
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:17,950
Eight!

458
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,961
Ohhhh.

459
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:43,472
This...gentleman
begins to annoy me.

460
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:55,583
No. The sauce and meat must rhyme.
Add a pinch of marigold and thyme.

461
00:29:55,613 --> 00:30:00,537
Your house, of course needs a stronger roof.
Eh? There's proof.

462
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:01,408
Cyrano.

463
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:03,480
Cyrano.

464
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,681
Come in and eat.

465
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:06,693
- What time is it?
- Not quite seven.

466
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:09,725
Oh, now, please, Cyrano.
A man without breakfast is like...

467
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,308
No.
Could she have changed her mind?

468
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:13,509
Aw, she wouldn't dare.

469
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:15,491
We were magnificent last night.

470
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:17,422
And at the theater, too.

471
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:19,914
'Then, as I end the refrain'...

472
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,987
When she arrives.
Where can we converse undisturbed?

473
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:24,789
Wherever you like.
My shop is yours.

474
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:27,501
The little dining room
is quite romantic.

475
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,093
'Thrust home!'
Yea gods, what a line.

476
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:32,255
- 'Then as I end the re...'
- Vanish.

477
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:33,716
- Uh, huh, she's come?
- Shhhh.

478
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:34,527
I swear.

479
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:43,785
Welcome.

480
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:56,136
- A pardon, one word.
- Oh, yes?

481
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:57,147
Have you a good digestion?

482
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,058
Oh, wonderful.

483
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,433
Eh, here are some éclairs.
Uh, creampuffs.

484
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:08,797
Some, uh, jellyrolls.
And do you like nature?

485
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:10,038
I adore it.

486
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,000
Go out and eat these in the sunshine.
Do not return.

487
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,081
But why?

488
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:14,552
Until you have finished them.

489
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:15,983
What do I do then?

490
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:28,655
Blessed above all others be the hour
when you remember to remember me,

491
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:31,457
and came to tell me...what?

492
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:33,409
To tell you that...

493
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,472
Before I dare tell you I...

494
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:40,515
Are you, I wonder, still
the same big brother almost

495
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:42,387
that you used to be
when we were children,

496
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:45,239
playing by the pond
in the old garden down there?

497
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:47,241
At Bergerac.
Those lovely summers.

498
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:49,373
You use to make swords
out of bulrushes.

499
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,485
And you, dandelions
also golden hair.

500
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:53,606
In those days
I could tell you everything.

501
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:55,538
And you did
everything I wished.

502
00:31:55,738 --> 00:32:00,512
Little Roxane, a sweet tyrone
with short skirts and long hair.

503
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,463
Was I pretty?

504
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:06,958
Not too plain.

505
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,181
Sometimes when you had fallen
or hurt your hand,

506
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:13,364
you used to come running to me,
and I would be your mother and say,

507
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:18,468
oh, with a very grownup voice,
'Now, what have you been doing to yourself?'

508
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:20,000
'Let me see.'

509
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:22,762
- Oh!
- No one that.

510
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:23,933
Wait, let me see.

511
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:27,246
Still. At your age?

512
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:29,518
Now, how did you do that?

513
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:32,621
Playing with the big boys
at the Place de Neanne.

514
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:34,122
Come here.

515
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:36,734
Such a wise little mother.

516
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:40,457
And tell me, while I wash this
blood away, how many you played with?

517
00:32:40,488 --> 00:32:42,559
- Oh, about a hundred.
- A hundred?

518
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,672
- More or less.
- It can't be.

519
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:46,803
No.

520
00:32:47,394 --> 00:32:49,445
Tell me what you were
going to tell me...

521
00:32:49,856 --> 00:32:51,047
if you dared.

522
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:53,789
I think I do dare, now.

523
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,182
It seems so like
those happy days long ago.

524
00:32:58,373 --> 00:32:59,514
Yes, I dare.

525
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:02,927
Listen...I love someone.

526
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:04,178
Yes?

527
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:05,890
Someone who does not know.

528
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,081
Yes?

529
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:10,714
Someone who loves me, too,
but is afraid of me and keeps away

530
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:12,085
and never says one word.

531
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:14,017
Yes.

532
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:15,959
Give my that hand.

533
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,831
Why, how hot it is.

534
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:22,144
Yes, he loves me.
I am sure of it.

535
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:23,285
Yes.

536
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,488
And he is a soldier, too,
in your own regiment,

537
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:27,469
your own company.

538
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:28,510
Yes.

539
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,241
Such a man.

540
00:33:30,962 --> 00:33:34,044
He is proud, noble, young, brave,

541
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,466
beautiful!

542
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:38,318
Beautiful.

543
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,811
What's the matter?

544
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:42,932
Oh, nothing.

545
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:45,985
It's this, my hand.

546
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:50,058
I love him.
That is all.

547
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,012
And I have never seen him
anywhere except in the theater.

548
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,494
You have never spoken?

549
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:58,576
Only with our hearts.

550
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:00,868
Well, then, how do you know?

551
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:06,062
Well, people talk about people,
and I hear things, and...

552
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:08,495
and I know.

553
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:11,337
You say he is in the guards?

554
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,329
His name?

555
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,073
Baron Christian de Neuvillette.

556
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:19,714
You know him?

557
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:21,456
He is not in the guards.

558
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:22,827
Yes, since last week.

559
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,359
He is only lately
come to Paris...

560
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,951
from Normandy.

561
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:30,884
So soon.
So soon we lose our hearts.

562
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:32,075
What...

563
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,036
Monsieur de Bergerac

564
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,668
I have eaten all the cakes.

565
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,100
Good.
Now, go out and enjoy nature.

566
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:41,934
But my dear child, you love
only words, wit, poetry.

567
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:45,777
Why, for all you know,
the man may be a savage or a fool.

568
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:50,121
Not with such eyes.
I read his soul in them.

569
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:54,195
Yes, all our souls are
written in our eyes.

570
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,558
And you have brought
me here to tell me this?

571
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:01,731
I do not yet quite understand,
madam, the reason for your confidence.

572
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:08,487
They say, that in your company,
it frightens me, you are all Gascon.

573
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,699
We pick a quarrel with any outsider
who intrudes himself.

574
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,100
Is that what you have heard?

575
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,003
- I'm so afraid for him.
- Not without reason.

576
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:19,587
And I thought you...
it's you whom they all respect and fear.

577
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:24,451
You want me to defend
your little Baron?

578
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:25,602
Will you?

579
00:35:26,663 --> 00:35:27,534
Just for me.

580
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:30,306
Because I have always
been your friend.

581
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:32,658
And this is what
you want of me?

582
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:34,300
Will you be his friend?

583
00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:38,073
I will be his friend.

584
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:38,914
And never let him
fight a duel.

585
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:39,935
No, never.

586
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:41,226
Promise?

587
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:42,857
I promise.

588
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:46,741
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
I knew I could rely on you.

589
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:51,295
Well, now I must go.

590
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,372
Oh, you never told
me about last night.

591
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:01,684
Why, you must
have been a hero.

592
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:06,138
Have write and tell me all about it,
and...about himself.

593
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,231
Oh, you are a darling.
We are great friends, are we not?

594
00:36:10,762 --> 00:36:12,233
He must write to me.

595
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:17,397
A hundred men against one.
You shall tell me the whole story

596
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:18,889
someday when we have time.

597
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:26,085
A hundred men.
What courage!

598
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:32,731
I have done better.

599
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:38,376
Well?

600
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:41,979
Let us leave this place.

601
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:43,550
But the whole company
is on its way here.

602
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,461
Oh, no.

603
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,803
On my heels. Naturally I told
them all about last night.

604
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:47,814
They're wild.

605
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:48,765
Here they are.

606
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:51,357
- Yes, but, why did you?
- Perhaps I can stop them.

607
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:52,909
Never mind.

608
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,161
Cyrano!

609
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,521
Eight dead men in the street.
Scandalous.

610
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:09,964
You know my edict
against dueling, nephew.

611
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:11,535
I expect to have it enforced.

612
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,898
Furthermore, I wish to know
who was responsible for last night's

613
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:16,369
outrage at the Place de Neanne.

614
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:17,800
I understand, Your Eminence.

615
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:20,142
Very well.
And now I have news

616
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,274
that should be more
to you liking.

617
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:29,381
I fear, in confidence, our
uneasy armistice with Spain is doomed.

618
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:30,381
My colonelcy?

619
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:32,643
You commission has been prepared.

620
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:34,865
Oh, thank you, uncle, thank you.

621
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:36,607
Oh, one thing more.

622
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:40,580
Last night at the theater,
the duel in rhyme,

623
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:42,952
that guardsman with a nose.

624
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:46,225
- Bergerac, that impossible Gascon.
- Yes, impossible.

625
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:48,287
- His treatment of Montfleury.
- Abominable.

626
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:51,220
- The arrogance with which he closed the play.
- Incredible.

627
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,122
- It will be a miracle if the Vicomte survives.
- A sorrow.

628
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:55,714
What will you do
with him, Your Eminence?

629
00:37:55,754 --> 00:37:57,095
I? Nothing.

630
00:37:57,135 --> 00:37:59,287
I thought I might
leave that to you.

631
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:00,498
To me?

632
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,271
Yes. Place him somewhere
in your service,

633
00:38:04,301 --> 00:38:05,893
with a comfortable allowance.

634
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,394
He looked a little threadbare.

635
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:11,027
I...You...But, Your Eminence.
You detest dueling.

636
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:11,968
Of course I do.

637
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:14,080
Why didn't you prevent it?

638
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,363
I should much prefer
that monsieur de Beregrac

639
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:21,316
live by the pen,
rather than die by the sword.

640
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:24,489
Do you not agree, Antoine?

641
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,582
By all means, Your Eminence.
By all means.

642
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:37,680
'And then, as I end the refrain...
thrust home.'

643
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:03,874
Monsieur de Bergerac.

644
00:39:05,415 --> 00:39:06,646
Your Excellency.

645
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:10,009
I have come to express my...

646
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:13,813
admiration for both
your exploits last night.

647
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,555
Indeed. Thank you.

648
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:20,168
My dear fellow,
we may have had our differences,

649
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:22,821
but I am disposed
to forget them.

650
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,982
That is very generous
of you, sir.

651
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:25,833
No, truly.

652
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:29,246
You are, it seems, a man
of many skills.

653
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:32,629
A rare combination
soldier and poet.

654
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,033
- Would you care to join my following?
- No, sir.

655
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:38,544
I do not follow.

656
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:41,267
I am told you have
written a play.

657
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:44,800
As you know, my uncle,
the Cardinal, is also a dramatist.

658
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,281
I might help you there.

659
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:49,344
Cyrano, now at last
you can have it performed.

660
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:50,495
Why not?

661
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:51,916
I could take it to him.

662
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,628
Really?

663
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,760
Of course.
Let him rewrite a few lines

664
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,072
here and there, and
he'll find a theater for you.

665
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:02,535
Rewrite...my lines?

666
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,457
Impossible.

667
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:07,350
Uh, when he likes a thing,
he pays well.

668
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,551
Yes, but not so well as I.

669
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:10,773
When I have made a line
that sings itself

670
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:12,534
I pay myself a hundred times.

671
00:40:12,564 --> 00:40:14,256
You are proud, my friend.

672
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,337
You have observed that?

673
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:17,779
- Cyrano.
See what we found in the street.

674
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:20,461
Plumes dropped in their flight
by those fine birds

675
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:22,183
who showed their
tail feathers!

676
00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:25,505
The man who hired
those scoundrels,

677
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:27,337
he must be an
angry man today.

678
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:28,758
Who was it?
Do you know?

679
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,120
It was I.

680
00:40:31,411 --> 00:40:35,204
I hired them to do the sort
of work we do not soil our hands with.

681
00:40:35,995 --> 00:40:38,277
Punishing an insolent poet.

682
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:40,949
They ought to be mounted
before they spoil.

683
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,191
What shall we do with them?

684
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:51,809
Sir, will you not return these
to your friends?

685
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,544
Have you read Don Quixote?

686
00:40:57,584 --> 00:41:00,006
I have and found
myself the hero.

687
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:03,128
Be so good as to read once more
the capture of the windmills.

688
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:04,370
Chapter 13.

689
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:07,562
Windmills, remember,
if you fight with them...

690
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:11,956
may swing round their huge arms
and cast you down into the mire.

691
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:14,378
Or up among the stars.

692
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,341
Gentlemen.

693
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:18,692
Gentlemen.

694
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:19,923
Gentlemen.

695
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:21,985
You've done it, now.

696
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:23,236
You've made your fortune.

697
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:24,447
He was willing to forget.

698
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,559
There you go again, growling.

699
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:28,841
Yesss,
this latest pose of yours,

700
00:41:28,881 --> 00:41:31,453
ruining every opportunity
that comes you way,

701
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:32,484
becomes exaggerated.

702
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:33,635
Very well, then, I exaggerate.

703
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,096
There are certain things
in this world

704
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,488
a man does well
to carry to extremes.

705
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:39,100
Your precious independence.
Your white plume.

706
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,801
How do you expect
to succeed in life?

707
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,792
What would you have me do?

708
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,984
Seek for the patronage
of some great man

709
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:47,277
and like a creeping vine
on a tall tree crawl upward

710
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:48,919
where I cannot stand alone?

711
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:50,250
No, thank you.

712
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:55,284
Be a buffoon in the vile hope
of teasing out a smile on some cold face.

713
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:57,116
No, thank you.

714
00:41:57,456 --> 00:41:59,668
Eat a toad for breakfast
every morning.

715
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,941
Make my knees calloused.
Cultivate a supple spine.

716
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:04,732
Wear out my belly
groveling in the dust.

717
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:05,813
No, thank you.

718
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:10,297
With my left hand scratch the back
of any swine that roots up gold for me

719
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,331
while my right, too proud to know
his partner's business, takes in the fee.

720
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,342
No, thank you.

721
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:19,235
Shall I use the fire God gave me
to burn incense all day long?

722
00:42:19,505 --> 00:42:20,446
No, thank you.

723
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:23,839
Struggle to insinuate my name
into the columns of the Gazette?

724
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:28,683
Calculate, scheme, be afraid?
Love more to make a visit than a poem?

725
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:31,426
Seek introductions, favors,
influences?

726
00:42:31,456 --> 00:42:32,487
No, thank you.

727
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:35,710
No, I thank you, and
again I thank you.

728
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:45,768
But, to sing, to laugh, to dream,
to walk in my own way,

729
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:47,960
free with and eye
to see things as they are.

730
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:50,693
A voice that means manhood.

731
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:54,096
To cut my have
the right shoes.

732
00:42:54,136 --> 00:43:01,112
And a word, a yes, a no,
to fight, or write,

733
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:03,904
but never to make
a line I have not heard

734
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,245
in my own heart.

735
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:07,848
To travel any
road under the sun,

736
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:10,250
under the stars,

737
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:14,994
nor care if fame or fortune
lie beyond the bourne.

738
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:17,726
Yet, with all modesty to say,

739
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:21,309
my soul be satisfied
with flowers,

740
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,481
with weeds,

741
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:26,324
with thorns, even,

742
00:43:27,395 --> 00:43:30,427
but gather them in the one garden
you may call your own.

743
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:33,941
In a word, I'm too proud
to be a parasite.

744
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,963
And if mine intellect the germ
that grows towering to heaven

745
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:38,264
like the mountain pine

746
00:43:38,855 --> 00:43:41,067
I stand not high, it may be,

747
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:43,959
but alone.

748
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,672
Alone, yes, but why
go about making enemies?

749
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:51,356
Watching other people
making friends...everywhere,

750
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,488
as a dog makes friends.

751
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:57,061
I mark the manner of
these canine courtesies,

752
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:02,285
and think, here comes,
thank heaven, another enemy.

753
00:44:02,325 --> 00:44:08,281
Yes, tell this to all the world,
and then to me say very softly

754
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:11,063
that she loves you not.

755
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:16,468
Let me be alone
for a moment.

756
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,581
Cyrano, wait.

757
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:22,293
Give us your story
of the fight.

758
00:44:23,064 --> 00:44:23,934
Presently.

759
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:25,546
No, the story, now!

760
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:27,507
Oh, let him alone.
There's time enough.

761
00:44:27,537 --> 00:44:28,899
I want it now!

762
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,634
As an example for that young
tadpole sneaking out the doorway.

763
00:44:34,664 --> 00:44:36,585
You, there.

764
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:42,370
Are you addressing me?

765
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:48,826
Yes, you flat-footed
Norman farmer.

766
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:53,530
You wish something of me?

767
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,012
Listen, Monsieur de...de...de
whatever your name is.

768
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:56,983
de Neuvillette!

769
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,295
Baron Christan de Neuvillette.

770
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:01,437
Very well, de Neuvillette.

771
00:45:01,737 --> 00:45:04,149
As you are a newcomer here,
you should know there is a

772
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:08,373
certain subject or object, if you prefer,
that is never mentioned among us.

773
00:45:08,813 --> 00:45:09,814
And that is...?

774
00:45:09,844 --> 00:45:10,975
Look at me!

775
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:13,837
You understand?

776
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,148
You mean...?

777
00:45:15,178 --> 00:45:17,571
Thus we never speak that word.

778
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,873
To even breathe it is
to have to do with him.

779
00:45:20,903 --> 00:45:25,247
He has exterminated several
whose mere tone of voice suggested...

780
00:45:25,277 --> 00:45:29,411
Would you die before your time?
Just mention anything convex.

781
00:45:29,451 --> 00:45:31,022
Or cartilaginous.

782
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:35,036
One word. One syllable.
One gesture. Nay, one sneeze.

783
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,828
And your handkerchief
becomes your winding sheet.

784
00:45:40,611 --> 00:45:41,421
Captain.

785
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:42,793
Sir?

786
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,596
What is the proper thing to do
when Gascons grow too boastful?

787
00:45:47,307 --> 00:45:50,329
Prove to them that one may
be a Norman and still have courage.

788
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:51,610
I thank you.

789
00:45:57,846 --> 00:45:59,878
Come on, Cyrano, your story.

790
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,063
Now, let me see.
Where shall we begin?

791
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:09,036
I followed with our host
to meet those scoundrels

792
00:46:09,076 --> 00:46:10,167
not knowing where
they might attack.

793
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,869
No lamps in those narrow
back streets.

794
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,131
No moon in the sky.

795
00:46:15,872 --> 00:46:17,753
Dark. Everything dark.

796
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:20,576
It was so dark, Mon Dieux,
you could not see beyond...

797
00:46:20,606 --> 00:46:22,007
Your nose!

798
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:48,610
Who...is that...man...there?

799
00:46:50,822 --> 00:46:51,943
A new recruit.

800
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:54,115
Arrived last week.

801
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,647
A recruit, eh?

802
00:46:57,448 --> 00:46:58,509
Ha, ha-.

803
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:01,892
His name is Christian de Neuvillette.

804
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:16,154
I see.

805
00:47:19,257 --> 00:47:20,098
Very well.

806
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,060
As I was saying.

807
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:28,525
It grew dark.

808
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:31,778
You could not see
your hand before your eyes.

809
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:36,072
I marched on thinking our all for
the sake of one amateur poet

810
00:47:36,112 --> 00:47:39,265
- Who wrote a verse whenever he took a..
- A nose full.

811
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:42,377
...whenever he took a notion.,

812
00:47:42,968 --> 00:47:45,210
and might antagonize
some dangerous man.

813
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,442
One powerful enough
to make me pay...

814
00:47:47,472 --> 00:47:48,593
Through the nose!

815
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:49,704
...pay the piper!

816
00:47:50,024 --> 00:47:52,046
After all, I thought,
why am I putting in my..

817
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:52,927
Nose!

818
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:55,789
...putting in my oar in a quarrel
that was none of mine,

819
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,861
however now that I am here,
I may as well go through with it.

820
00:47:57,891 --> 00:47:59,462
Come Gascon, do your duty.

821
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,474
Suddenly a sword
flashed in the dark!

822
00:48:01,544 --> 00:48:02,435
I caught it fair...

823
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:03,436
On the nose!

824
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:05,758
...on my blade!

825
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:07,159
Before I knew it,
there I was...

826
00:48:07,189 --> 00:48:08,320
Rubbing noses!

827
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,472
...crossing swords with
harvard's joy once.

828
00:48:10,502 --> 00:48:11,573
I had the bottom then...

829
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:12,534
A nosegay!

830
00:48:12,574 --> 00:48:13,795
...a monstrous crab tree.

831
00:48:14,245 --> 00:48:16,507
He went down for as a wave.

832
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:17,628
I charged...

833
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:19,230
Who was in the air hard.

834
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,090
...at the two of them.

835
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:22,543
Another lunged,
and I parried...

836
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,864
Through your nose!

837
00:48:23,894 --> 00:48:25,956
Right out of here!
All of you go!

838
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:26,766
Leave me with him.

839
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:45,322
To my arms, sir.
You have courage.

840
00:48:45,352 --> 00:48:46,544
- That pleases me.
- Why?

841
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:48,285
Come, do you not know
I am her brother?

842
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:49,326
Whose?

843
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:50,917
Hers. Roxane.

844
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,061
Brother?

845
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:56,843
You?

846
00:48:56,873 --> 00:48:58,824
Well, a distant cousin.
Much the same.

847
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:01,126
- Then she has told you?
- Everything.

848
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:03,358
- She loves me?
- Perhaps.

849
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,631
My dear sir, more than I can say.
I am honored.

850
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:08,723
- Rather sudden.
- Oh, please, forgive me.

851
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:10,955
If you knew how
much I have admired you.

852
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:14,308
- Yes, yes, and all those noses.
- Please. I apologize.

853
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:17,371
Roxane expects a letter.

854
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:18,992
- From me?
- Yes, why not?

855
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:19,873
Oh,, No.

856
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,575
- Once I write, that ruins everything.
- Why?

857
00:49:22,615 --> 00:49:25,718
Because, any schoolboy can write
to her more gracefully than I.

858
00:49:26,288 --> 00:49:27,429
A fool!

859
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,263
- You did not attack me like a fool.
- Anyone can pick a quarrel.

860
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:33,284
No, I'm never at loss
for words among men,

861
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:37,969
but with any women...
paralyzed...speechless, dumb.

862
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:40,311
I'm one of those
stammering idiots

863
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:41,982
who can not court a woman.

864
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:42,883
Really?

865
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,415
As for myself,
it seems to me that

866
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:49,018
given the opportunity,
and if I put my mind to it,

867
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:52,111
I could do that..
rather well.

868
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:54,593
Oh, is I had words to say
what I have here!

869
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:56,175
If I were handsome
like you.

870
00:49:56,845 --> 00:50:00,508
Together, we could make
one mighty hero of romance.

871
00:50:00,548 --> 00:50:02,060
If only I had your wit.

872
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,445
Borrow it, then.

873
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:09,887
What?

874
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,229
Tell me,

875
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,512
would you dare repeat to her
the words I gave you day by day?

876
00:50:17,073 --> 00:50:19,165
Send to her
the letters that I write?

877
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:21,547
I mean, that Roxane
should have no disillusionment.

878
00:50:21,927 --> 00:50:23,569
Come, shall we win her
both together?

879
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:24,549
For you?

880
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,721
- Why, Cyrano...
- Christian, why not?

881
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,603
I...I'm afraid.

882
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:30,785
Afraid that when you
have her all alone, you will lose her.

883
00:50:30,975 --> 00:50:33,177
Have not fear,
it is your self she loves.

884
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:34,678
Give her yourself.

885
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:40,433
Put into words,
my words...upon your lips.

886
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:41,945
Will you?

887
00:50:43,546 --> 00:50:44,797
Will you?

888
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:47,509
Does it mean
so much to you?

889
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,131
It means...

890
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,835
It means a comedy,
a situation for a poet.

891
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:55,126
Come, shall we collaborate?

892
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:59,200
I'll be your cloak of darkness,
your enchanted sword,

893
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,112
your ring to charm
the fairy princess.

894
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,966
Think!
Is the prize not worth the danger?

895
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:09,769
My friend!

896
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:12,531
My friend.

897
00:51:13,682 --> 00:51:16,895
Take my heart.
I shall have it all the more.

898
00:51:17,145 --> 00:51:20,448
Plucking the flowers,
we will keep the plant in bloom.

899
00:51:20,598 --> 00:51:22,810
Thus do I love thee,
my darling.

900
00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:26,474
Idiot.

901
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:29,006
There are a dozen
ways to read that line.

902
00:51:29,046 --> 00:51:31,308
Can't you give it some meaning?
Any meaning!

903
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,759
THUS do I love thee!

904
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,090
Thus do "I" love thee.

905
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,361
Thus do I LOVE thee.

906
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:37,743
Thus do I love THEE,
THEE, THEE.

907
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:42,498
Who knows your smile
has known a perfect thing.

908
00:51:42,528 --> 00:51:45,220
You are a white rose,
wherein love lies in ambush

909
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,002
for its natural prey.

910
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:50,585
In the garden of my heart,
you are the most...

911
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:52,506
eh, the most...

912
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,580
fragrant blossom.

913
00:51:57,871 --> 00:52:01,614
As the tender sapling
thirsts for rain,

914
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:04,737
as the eagle seeks the sky,

915
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:07,890
as the wave
hurtles toward the shore,

916
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,832
my heart yearns for you.

917
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:12,664
Good, good.

918
00:52:12,814 --> 00:52:15,587
You know, you're beginning
to have a feel for words.

919
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:18,859
- Words. I'm sick of words.
- Those are your weapons.

920
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,041
How else do you conquer?

921
00:52:20,051 --> 00:52:20,981
Yes, but when, when?

922
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:23,043
They're fighting in the north, now.
You know that.

923
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,544
The Regiment will be
called up any day,

924
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:25,695
and I've never
even kissed her.

925
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:28,798
Patience, my boy, patience.

926
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:29,969
I've been patient.

927
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:33,142
Why, she sees the Compte de Guiche
as often as she does me.

928
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:37,986
Do you suppose
she's playing with me?

929
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:39,367
Making a fool of me?

930
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:41,750
Impossible.

931
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,081
How can you say?
How do you know?

932
00:52:44,082 --> 00:52:48,265
Cyrano, you have her confidence.
You could find out.

933
00:52:56,182 --> 00:52:57,573
Nonsense, I say.

934
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:00,326
Oh, very well.

935
00:53:00,756 --> 00:53:02,077
I'll scout the terrain.

936
00:53:02,117 --> 00:53:04,089
Listen, Cyrano,
intelligently, discreetly.

937
00:53:04,129 --> 00:53:05,050
Yes.

938
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,231
With finesse.

939
00:53:08,903 --> 00:53:12,406
And, uh, what do you think
of Christian after all these weeks?

940
00:53:12,516 --> 00:53:14,929
He is beautiful,
but he's brilliant.

941
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:16,660
- And I love him.
- Good!

942
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,652
Uh, do you find him intellectual?

943
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:20,503
- More so than you, even.
- Huh?

944
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:23,376
- Oh, I didn't mean.
- No, no, no, I am glad.

945
00:53:23,406 --> 00:53:26,198
No man ever so beautifully
said those things.

946
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,811
Those pretty nothings
to everything.

947
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:32,694
Sometimes, he,. he, he falls
into a reverie.

948
00:53:33,355 --> 00:53:36,027
His inspiration..fails.

949
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:40,861
But, then all at once,
he will say something absolutely...

950
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,293
Ah!

951
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:43,684
Really?

952
00:53:44,394 --> 00:53:45,836
How like a man!

953
00:53:45,866 --> 00:53:49,149
You think because a man
has a handsome face he must be a fool.

954
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,721
Not necessarily.

955
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:55,344
Uh, he talks well about, uh,
matters of the heart?

956
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:59,358
He does not talk.
He rhapsodizes. He dreams.

957
00:53:59,398 --> 00:54:03,301
Only the other night he said to me,
extemporaneously, mind you.

958
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:04,162
Oh, of course.

959
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:07,605
'Take my heart.
I shall have it all the more.

960
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:11,708
'Plucking the flowers
we will keep the plants in bloom.'

961
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:13,680
Well?

962
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,482
Umm, passable.

963
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:16,963
He writes well?

964
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,035
Wonderfully, listen:

965
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,468
'Knowing you have in store
more heart to give

966
00:54:22,508 --> 00:54:25,120
- 'than I to find heart room...'
- The first he has too much heart,

967
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,362
then too little. Just how much heart
does he need?

968
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:28,703
You are teasing.

969
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,834
You are jealous!

970
00:54:29,874 --> 00:54:30,655
Jealous?

971
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:31,406
Yes.

972
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:32,807
Poets are all alike.

973
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:36,630
Would you dare
criticize these lines?

974
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:42,075
'Only believe that unto you
my whole heart gives one cry.

975
00:54:42,515 --> 00:54:46,449
'And writing, writes down
more than you receive.

976
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:50,993
'Sending you kisses
through my fingertips.

977
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:55,006
'Lady, oh, read my letter
with your lips.'

978
00:54:56,327 --> 00:55:00,811
Yes, those last lines,
but he overwrites.

979
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:01,962
Listen to this.

980
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:02,993
Do you know
them all by heart?

981
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,064
Every one.

982
00:55:04,104 --> 00:55:05,495
Well, I may call
that flattering.

983
00:55:05,525 --> 00:55:06,306
He is a master.

984
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,848
- Oh, come..
- Yes, a master.

985
00:55:08,858 --> 00:55:12,271
Huh, a master,...
if you will.

986
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:17,526
And, uh, when do you
bestow the laurel wreath?

987
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:22,300
How many prodigies of poetry
must this new Hercules perform?

988
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,501
I do not know.

989
00:55:24,372 --> 00:55:28,596
My friend, you men own the world
and all that's in it.

990
00:55:29,036 --> 00:55:35,011
Woman is at best a prize, a property
valued much the same as a horse or a dog,

991
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:39,035
unlike the pear and sheen of skin
and soundness of teeth and limb.

992
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:44,900
Well, if I must be chattel,
then the terms shall be mine,

993
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,513
and the price according
to my own values.

994
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:49,704
There.

995
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,497
I see.

996
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:56,920
Christian tells me
that you meet tonight.

997
00:55:59,553 --> 00:56:02,255
What would you have him
speak about?

998
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,958
Oh, nothing,

999
00:56:05,308 --> 00:56:06,579
and everything.

1000
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:11,193
I shall say, speak to me
of love in your own words.

1001
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:13,865
Improvise, rhapsodize.

1002
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:15,847
Be eloquent.

1003
00:56:16,968 --> 00:56:18,599
But you will not tell him,
will you?

1004
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:20,331
Ah, perish the thought.

1005
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:23,434
Madame, Compte de Guiche.

1006
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:29,889
Madame.

1007
00:56:33,032 --> 00:56:33,953
Monsieur.

1008
00:56:34,844 --> 00:56:35,845
Madame.

1009
00:56:38,647 --> 00:56:41,349
Monsieur.

1010
00:56:50,517 --> 00:56:52,179
- Christian, quick.
- No.

1011
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,121
There's still time to learn your lines.
No.

1012
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,853
I have some brilliant phrases for you,
brilliant, sensitive...

1013
00:56:56,883 --> 00:56:57,594
No.

1014
00:56:58,244 --> 00:56:59,255
I'll have not more of it.

1015
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:01,347
Taking all my words, my sentences
all from you,

1016
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:03,589
- making our love a little comedy.
- Don't you real...

1017
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,581
It was a game at first,
but now she cares.

1018
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:06,491
Huh?

1019
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:07,853
Thanks to you.
Uh.

1020
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:10,165
I'm not afraid any longer.
I'll speak for myself, now.

1021
00:57:10,195 --> 00:57:11,025
Oh, undoubtedly.

1022
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:13,097
I will. You shall see!

1023
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:16,220
Besides, I know enough
to take a woman in my arms,

1024
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,981
and tonight, I will.

1025
00:57:21,184 --> 00:57:22,535
Christian!

1026
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:24,327
Thank you, my friend,
and goodbye.

1027
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,159
- Christian, I beg of you.
- Leave me!

1028
00:57:26,189 --> 00:57:27,950
- You're making a grave error.
- Go away!

1029
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:31,663
So be it.

1030
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:38,570
Christian.

1031
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,711
Roxane.

1032
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:42,463
I'm so glad you are early.

1033
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:45,536
Let us stay out here
in the moonlight.

1034
00:57:46,286 --> 00:57:47,627
It's so pleasant.

1035
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:50,770
Sit down.

1036
00:57:53,593 --> 00:57:54,864
There, so.

1037
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:00,929
Now, speak to me.

1038
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,621
I love you.

1039
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:05,483
Yes, speak to me of love.

1040
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:10,548
I...love you.

1041
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,799
Now, be eloquent.
Be brilliant for me.

1042
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,101
Tonight of all nights.

1043
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:18,725
I love you...so.

1044
00:58:20,776 --> 00:58:24,800
You have your scene.
Now, improvise, rhapsodize.

1045
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:28,743
I love you...
very much!

1046
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:34,779
I ask for cream,
and you give me milk and water.

1047
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,673
Tell me firstly,
how you love me.

1048
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:40,964
Very much!

1049
00:58:42,305 --> 00:58:43,626
Is that all you feel?

1050
00:58:43,657 --> 00:58:46,549
Your throat, if only
I might kiss it.

1051
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:47,360
Christian!

1052
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,711
But, Roxane, I love you.

1053
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:50,052
Again.

1054
00:58:50,082 --> 00:58:51,644
No, not again.
I do not love you.

1055
00:58:54,686 --> 00:58:55,737
That is better.

1056
00:58:56,578 --> 00:59:00,071
I...I adore you!

1057
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:01,072
Oh!

1058
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:03,274
I know I grow absurd.

1059
00:59:03,304 --> 00:59:06,076
And that distresses me as much
as if you had grown ugly!

1060
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:12,121
Please. Gather your dreams
together into words.

1061
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:15,044
I...um, I...

1062
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,496
I know. You love me!
Good night!

1063
00:59:17,526 --> 00:59:18,657
Oh, but wait, please!

1064
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:19,748
I was going to say...

1065
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:21,730
That you adore me.
Yes, I know that, too.

1066
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,942
-No, go away.
- I...

1067
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:47,112
A great success.

1068
00:59:48,183 --> 00:59:48,964
Help me.

1069
00:59:48,994 --> 00:59:50,865
Not I.
Speak for yourself, my friend.

1070
00:59:50,905 --> 00:59:52,467
Why I...I can't.

1071
00:59:52,497 --> 00:59:55,289
Well, at least you know enough
to take a woman in your arms.

1072
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:56,931
Oh, Cyrano, please!

1073
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,862
What, and make your love
a little comedy.

1074
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:01,315
Cyrano, I cannot live
unless I win her back, now.

1075
01:00:01,355 --> 01:00:02,165
This moment!

1076
01:00:02,195 --> 01:00:05,148
This moment. How the devil
am I to teach you now, this mo...

1077
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:06,199
Her window.

1078
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,951
- Help me, Cyrano, help me.
- Shhhh.

1079
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:12,064
It does seem fairly dark.

1080
01:00:12,104 --> 01:00:13,045
Well? Well?

1081
01:00:14,756 --> 01:00:16,458
It is more than you deserve.

1082
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,280
must try out what can be done.

1083
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,311
Stand over there.

1084
01:00:23,674 --> 01:00:26,777
Idiot, here, before the
balcony. I'll whisper you what to say.

1085
01:00:26,817 --> 01:00:28,658
- She'll hear..
- Shhhh. Call her.

1086
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,970
Roxane.

1087
01:00:32,232 --> 01:00:34,614
Roxane.

1088
01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:40,048
Who's calling?

1089
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:41,530
Christian.

1090
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,961
You again.

1091
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:44,713
I...had to tell you.

1092
01:00:45,003 --> 01:00:46,634
No. Go away.
You tell me nothing.

1093
01:00:46,664 --> 01:00:47,685
Please.

1094
01:00:47,725 --> 01:00:49,537
You do not
love me anymore.

1095
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:52,109
No, not anymore.

1096
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,641
I love you evermore,

1097
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,354
and everymore and more.

1098
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,946
Oh, a little better.

1099
01:01:02,148 --> 01:01:05,471
Love grows and struggles
like an angry child.

1100
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:07,933
Breaking my heart.

1101
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:10,385
His cradle...

1102
01:01:10,425 --> 01:01:11,946
Better still.

1103
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,709
But such a babe is dangerous.

1104
01:01:15,229 --> 01:01:17,461
Why not have
smothered it newborn?

1105
01:01:19,203 --> 01:01:20,614
And so I do.

1106
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:22,616
And yet he lives.

1107
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:26,239
I found as you sha...
you shall find

1108
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,634
this newborn babe...
and infant Hercules!

1109
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:32,865
Good.

1110
01:01:32,995 --> 01:01:34,256
Strong enough at birth

1111
01:01:35,077 --> 01:01:36,938
to strangle
those two serpents

1112
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:38,089
doubt and

1113
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:38,930
What?

1114
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,241
pride!

1115
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:41,783
Why, very good.

1116
01:01:42,673 --> 01:01:45,226
Only, tell me why
you speak so haltingly.

1117
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:47,928
Has your imagination
gone...lame?

1118
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,482
This grows too difficult.

1119
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:55,675
Your words tonight
hesitate, why?

1120
01:01:55,985 --> 01:02:00,329
Through the warm summer gloom,
they grope in darkness

1121
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:02,050
toward the light of you.

1122
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:05,223
My words are
heavy with honey,

1123
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,724
like returning bees.

1124
01:02:07,555 --> 01:02:09,677
Yet they must fly so high.

1125
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:11,509
Come nearer then.
Stand you on the bench.

1126
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:12,369
No.

1127
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:13,560
Then I'll come down.

1128
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,481
NO!

1129
01:02:14,942 --> 01:02:16,753
And why so great a no?

1130
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:20,296
Let me enjoy the one
moment I ever...

1131
01:02:21,087 --> 01:02:24,490
My one chance
to speak to you...unseen.

1132
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,671
Unseen?

1133
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,122
Yes. Yes.

1134
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,765
Night making all things
dimly beautiful

1135
01:02:29,795 --> 01:02:31,156
one veil over us both.

1136
01:02:31,426 --> 01:02:33,428
You need no eyes
to hear my heart.

1137
01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:37,802
Oh, tonight, let it seem as if
I speak for the first time.

1138
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:39,503
For the first time?

1139
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:40,394
Yes.

1140
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:43,176
Your voice, even,
is not the same.

1141
01:02:43,206 --> 01:02:44,387
How should it be.

1142
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,849
I have another
voice tonight.

1143
01:02:45,879 --> 01:02:48,651
My own, myself,... daring!

1144
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:50,012
Why daring?

1145
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:54,006
Because, what am I, what is any man
would he dare ask for you?

1146
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:58,189
Therefore my heart has hidden behind
poetic words and tinsel phrases.

1147
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:01,052
But are they not sweet,
those pretty phrases?

1148
01:03:01,082 --> 01:03:03,044
Not enough sweet
for you and me tonight.

1149
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:06,657
You never spoke
to me like this.

1150
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:08,929
I tell you, there comes
one moment, once,

1151
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:11,221
and heaven help those
who pass that moment by,

1152
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:13,533
when beauty stands
looking into the soul

1153
01:03:13,573 --> 01:03:19,238
with grave, sweet eyes,
that sicken at pretty words.

1154
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,692
Yes...that is love.

1155
01:03:23,722 --> 01:03:24,442
Love.

1156
01:03:24,482 --> 01:03:26,694
A love beyond breath,
beyond reason,

1157
01:03:26,724 --> 01:03:29,026
beyond love's own
power of loving.

1158
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:31,639
Your name is like a golden bell
hung in my heart,

1159
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:35,892
and when I think of you I tremble,
and the bell swings and rings,

1160
01:03:36,353 --> 01:03:43,329
Roxane! Roxane!
Along my veins...Roxane.

1161
01:03:46,452 --> 01:03:51,426
Yes...that is love.

1162
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:53,228
Yes that is love.

1163
01:03:53,548 --> 01:03:56,380
That wind of terrible
and jealous beauty,

1164
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,665
that dark fire,
that soaring, blinding music.

1165
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,158
Yet, you may take my happiness
to make you happier

1166
01:04:05,198 --> 01:04:06,880
even though you
never know I gave it to you.

1167
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:13,175
Only let me hear, sometimes, all alone,
the distant laughter of your joy.

1168
01:04:14,216 --> 01:04:15,948
Do you begin
to understand a little?

1169
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:19,681
Can you feel my soul there
in the darkness breathe on you?

1170
01:04:20,712 --> 01:04:24,115
Oh, only tonight,
now I dare say these things.

1171
01:04:24,275 --> 01:04:26,887
I to you, and you hear them.

1172
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:30,140
It is my voice, mine, my own
that makes you tremble

1173
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:32,882
there in the green gloom,
above me, for you do tremble

1174
01:04:32,922 --> 01:04:35,605
as a blossom among the leaves,
you tremble, and I can feel

1175
01:04:35,635 --> 01:04:37,166
all the way down along
this jasmine branch

1176
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:41,200
whether you will unhold
the passion of you trembling.

1177
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,462
Yes, I do tremble.

1178
01:04:44,743 --> 01:04:47,385
And I weep, and I love you,
and I am yours,

1179
01:04:47,415 --> 01:04:49,227
and you have made me thus.

1180
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:55,762
I have done this to you.

1181
01:04:57,434 --> 01:04:58,895
I myself.

1182
01:05:02,488 --> 01:05:04,760
Only let me ask
one thing more.

1183
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:06,422
I want a kiss!

1184
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:09,605
You ask me for...

1185
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:10,585
I...yes.

1186
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:11,786
That is to say...

1187
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:13,298
I mean...

1188
01:05:13,668 --> 01:05:14,979
You've gone too far.

1189
01:05:15,009 --> 01:05:16,901
If she's willing, why
not make the most of it?

1190
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:21,805
I, I ask.
I know I ask too much.

1191
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:23,957
Only one?

1192
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,169
Is that all?

1193
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,752
All?
How much more than all?

1194
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:33,576
I know I startle you,
I...I ask, I ask you to refuse.

1195
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:34,747
Why? Why? Why?

1196
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:35,898
Christian, be quiet.

1197
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:36,979
What is that your say?

1198
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:39,361
I am angry with myself,
because I know I go too far

1199
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:43,825
and so I say to myself,
CHRISTIAN, BE QUIET!

1200
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:45,856
Watch it, someone comes.

1201
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:56,746
Well, sir, I am looking
for the house of madame Roxane Robin.

1202
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:01,020
This is not the house. That way.
To the right. Keep to the right.

1203
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:01,900
I thank you sir.

1204
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:05,453
I shall say my beads for you
to the very last bead.

1205
01:06:06,915 --> 01:06:08,256
Win me that kiss?

1206
01:06:08,947 --> 01:06:09,647
No!

1207
01:06:09,857 --> 01:06:11,359
Sooner or later.

1208
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:18,095
So that is true.

1209
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:25,131
Sooner or later must be so, because,
she is young, and you are handsome.

1210
01:06:26,762 --> 01:06:32,837
Since it must be, I'd rather be
myself the cause, if it must be.

1211
01:06:40,965 --> 01:06:42,266
Are you still there?

1212
01:06:42,296 --> 01:06:43,076
Yes.

1213
01:06:44,327 --> 01:06:46,349
We were speaking of...

1214
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,063
A kiss.
- A kiss.

1215
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,954
And what is a kiss
when all is done?

1216
01:06:52,545 --> 01:06:54,697
A vow taken before
the shrine of memory.

1217
01:06:54,817 --> 01:06:57,269
A rosy dot
over the "i" of loving.

1218
01:06:57,409 --> 01:07:00,271
- A secret whisper
to listen if the past.

1219
01:07:00,301 --> 01:07:01,272
Shhh.

1220
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:04,345
A moment free to mortal
with a rush of wing from Ceden.

1221
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:05,846
A sacrament of blossoms.

1222
01:07:05,886 --> 01:07:10,881
A new song sung by two hearts
to an old, simple tune.

1223
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:12,062
Hush.

1224
01:07:12,092 --> 01:07:13,683
Why? What shame?

1225
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:18,948
No.
No shame.

1226
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:20,409
Then come.

1227
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:23,322
Gather your sacred blossoms.

1228
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:26,875
Your moment made immortal.

1229
01:07:26,885 --> 01:07:28,106
Climb!

1230
01:07:28,306 --> 01:07:29,947
- But, climb?
- Many more!

1231
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:41,417
Roxane.

1232
01:07:53,758 --> 01:07:57,442
Ah, Roxane.
I have won what I have wanted.

1233
01:07:57,992 --> 01:08:03,086
A feast of love,
and I am faint with hunger.

1234
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:08,721
Yet, I have something here
that is mine now,...

1235
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:11,063
and was not mine before.

1236
01:08:11,904 --> 01:08:14,476
I spoke the words
that won her.

1237
01:08:15,577 --> 01:08:22,183
She kisses my words.
My words...upon his lips.

1238
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:32,372
What, dear Father,
lost your way again?

1239
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:33,974
But, she lives here,
Madame Robin.

1240
01:08:34,004 --> 01:08:35,535
Oh, I thought
you said, Rolen?

1241
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:37,557
No, r..o..b..i..n, Robin.

1242
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:38,738
Oh, Robin, I see.

1243
01:08:38,778 --> 01:08:40,800
I'm too old
to chase wild geese

1244
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,791
- my feet...
- Oh, what a shame,

1245
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,634
however, I'm sure there's someone at home.

1246
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:48,576
What is it?

1247
01:08:48,606 --> 01:08:52,290
Yeah, I'm looking for
the young lady, Madam Rolen

1248
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,561
Rolen?

1249
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:54,802
Robin!

1250
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,774
Madame!
A letter for you.

1251
01:08:58,315 --> 01:08:59,796
Yes, yes, I heard.

1252
01:09:00,697 --> 01:09:01,478
Cyrano.

1253
01:09:01,518 --> 01:09:03,810
Uh, passing by cousin,
I saw this light.

1254
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:08,063
Uh, some matter
profitable to the soul.

1255
01:09:08,093 --> 01:09:10,285
A very noble lord gave it to me.

1256
01:09:10,486 --> 01:09:11,376
What is it?

1257
01:09:12,457 --> 01:09:14,839
My regiment has been
ordered to the front.

1258
01:09:14,869 --> 01:09:17,231
<i>I cannot allow you
to delay any longer.</i>

1259
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:19,563
<i>This simple old monk,
who knows nothing,</i>

1260
01:09:19,593 --> 01:09:21,936
<i>will marry us tonight.
My love, Antoine de Guiche.</i>

1261
01:09:24,898 --> 01:09:26,630
Father, this letter
concerns you.

1262
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:31,684
"Madame, the Cardinal
will have his way,

1263
01:09:31,724 --> 01:09:33,285
"although against your will.

1264
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:35,908
"That is why I am
sending this to you,

1265
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,230
"by a most holy man.

1266
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,922
"Intelligent, discreet.

1267
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:44,425
"You will communicate
to him our order to perform

1268
01:09:44,665 --> 01:09:48,929
"here and at once
the rite of holy matrimony.

1269
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:53,683
"You and Christian will be
married privately in your house.

1270
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:57,537
"Be resigned to the
Cardinal's command,

1271
01:09:57,577 --> 01:09:59,709
"who sends herewith
his blessings.

1272
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:01,840
"Your very humble,
and etcetera..."

1273
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:04,533
Oh, this is terrible.

1274
01:10:06,004 --> 01:10:07,636
Oh, you're to be
the, uh...

1275
01:10:07,676 --> 01:10:09,277
I am to be the bridegroom.

1276
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:14,021
Uh, look here.
A postscript.

1277
01:10:14,572 --> 01:10:20,116
"Give to the monastery,
in my name 120 pieces of gold."

1278
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:21,868
One hundred and twenty...

1279
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,332
Oh, a worthy lord.
A very worthy lord.

1280
01:10:27,273 --> 01:10:29,835
Daughter, resign yourself.

1281
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,887
I am resigned.

1282
01:10:40,164 --> 01:10:42,316
The Guiche is coming, too.
Don't let him enter.

1283
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:43,547
Not let him enter?

1284
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:45,609
Until we're married, please.

1285
01:11:03,174 --> 01:11:04,165
Me?

1286
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:06,197
- Why, where did you come from?
- The moon.

1287
01:11:06,227 --> 01:11:07,168
- You...
- From the moon.

1288
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:08,529
I have just returned
from the moon.

1289
01:11:08,559 --> 01:11:10,260
- The fellow's mad!
-Like a bomb, I tell you,

1290
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,972
- I fell from the moon!
- Your feet must...

1291
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:13,293
I say THE MOON!

1292
01:11:13,323 --> 01:11:15,425
- Very well, if you say so.
- Thank you.

1293
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,456
Raving mad.

1294
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,700
- Where am I?
- My dear sir!

1295
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:21,931
- What place is this?
What country?

1296
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:24,022
- Please, let me pass.
- This face, good heavens!

1297
01:11:24,063 --> 01:11:26,565
Maul, a robber.
Where am I?

1298
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:30,688
- A lady is waiting for me.
- Oh, this is Paris, huh?

1299
01:11:30,728 --> 01:11:31,479
You fool!

1300
01:11:31,509 --> 01:11:32,660
Dear old Paris.

1301
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,613
Excuse my appearance.
I arrived by the last thunderbolt.

1302
01:11:35,653 --> 01:11:37,835
A trifled singed
as I passed through the ether.

1303
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:39,186
Monsieur!

1304
01:11:39,226 --> 01:11:39,946
Sir?

1305
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,618
That will do, now. I wish...

1306
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:43,469
I know, you wish to look for
my own list of nature for moons

1307
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,691
and happiness and character
of it's surface, if any.

1308
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:46,933
I desire no such thing, I...

1309
01:11:46,973 --> 01:11:47,933
Of course not.

1310
01:11:50,816 --> 01:11:52,207
You wish to know
by what mysterious

1311
01:11:52,237 --> 01:11:53,448
means I reached the moon.

1312
01:11:53,488 --> 01:11:55,750
Well, a very secret affair of state,

1313
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:59,654
but confidentially
a new invention of my own.

1314
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:01,075
Drunk, two ways.
Well a man..

1315
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:03,937
Oh, no. In truth I have
my choice of several inventions.

1316
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:04,788
Uh?

1317
01:12:04,828 --> 01:12:08,742
Yes, several ways
to violate the virgin sky.

1318
01:12:08,772 --> 01:12:10,103
Several?

1319
01:12:10,143 --> 01:12:11,404
Several.

1320
01:12:11,434 --> 01:12:15,417
As, for instance, smoke
having a natural tendency to rise,

1321
01:12:15,448 --> 01:12:19,951
blow in a globe
enough to raise me.

1322
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:21,203
Yes, that makes one.

1323
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:24,686
Again, I might construct a rocket
in the shape of a HUGE locust

1324
01:12:24,726 --> 01:12:28,719
driven by impulses up within
a saltpeter from the rear

1325
01:12:28,759 --> 01:12:31,962
and thus speed upwards,
like, thus!

1326
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:33,173
Yes, another?

1327
01:12:33,203 --> 01:12:36,866
Finally, seated on an iron plate,
hurl a magnet into the air.

1328
01:12:36,896 --> 01:12:39,729
The iron follows.
I catch the magnet.

1329
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:43,252
Throw it again, and
so proceed indefinitely.

1330
01:12:43,282 --> 01:12:45,384
Excellent, and
which did you adopt?

1331
01:12:49,377 --> 01:12:50,298
Why none of them.

1332
01:12:50,889 --> 01:12:52,280
Yet another.

1333
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,671
Which was...?

1334
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,441
Guess.

1335
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:07,313
Ahhh, I can't!

1336
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:09,044
Try.

1337
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:11,927
Interesting idiot, this.

1338
01:13:23,307 --> 01:13:24,498
Have you guessed it yet?

1339
01:13:24,518 --> 01:13:25,919
Why, no, what is it?

1340
01:13:31,744 --> 01:13:33,836
Alas, you will never know,
but no matter.

1341
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:36,438
You are free and
they are bound in wedlock.

1342
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,981
I drunk that voice,
and that nose, Cyrano!

1343
01:13:39,011 --> 01:13:41,683
Cyrano. This very moment
they have exchanged vows.

1344
01:13:41,723 --> 01:13:42,434
Who?

1345
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,510
My sincere compliments.

1346
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,883
You, also, my traveler in space.

1347
01:13:52,923 --> 01:13:55,785
My Lord, the heads of Capathieu
and Joyce have joined together.

1348
01:13:55,825 --> 01:13:56,736
Quite so!

1349
01:13:57,867 --> 01:14:02,151
Madame, kindly bid
your... husband farewell.

1350
01:14:02,181 --> 01:14:04,663
Your regiment leaves tonight, sir.
Report at once!

1351
01:14:05,594 --> 01:14:07,315
But, the Cadets are not called.

1352
01:14:07,346 --> 01:14:09,848
They are, indeed, and
under my command.

1353
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:13,081
Out there we may
have an accounting.

1354
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,133
Somehow, that news
fails to disquiet me.

1355
01:14:17,164 --> 01:14:19,196
Here are the orders.
Baron, deliver this.

1356
01:14:20,507 --> 01:14:21,658
Christian!

1357
01:14:24,811 --> 01:14:27,673
The bridal night
is not so near.

1358
01:14:28,104 --> 01:14:31,417
Somehow that news
fails to disquiet me.

1359
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,362
Baron, you have your orders.

1360
01:14:54,307 --> 01:14:55,568
Farewell, Roxane.

1361
01:14:56,328 --> 01:14:58,530
Take care of him, for me.
Promise me never to let him

1362
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,441
do anything dangerous.

1363
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:00,932
I will do my best.
I cannot promise.

1364
01:15:00,962 --> 01:15:03,014
I thought you brave always.
Make him be careful.

1365
01:15:03,054 --> 01:15:04,115
Yes, yes, I'll try.

1366
01:15:04,155 --> 01:15:05,887
Be sure to keep him
warm and dry!

1367
01:15:05,927 --> 01:15:07,198
Yes, if possible.

1368
01:15:07,238 --> 01:15:09,870
Have him write to me
every single day!

1369
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,142
That, I promise you.

1370
01:15:58,913 --> 01:15:59,634
Halt!

1371
01:16:21,183 --> 01:16:22,033
Uh!

1372
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:06,322
The situation
is simple, gentlemen.

1373
01:17:06,572 --> 01:17:11,497
We have besieged Arras.
The Prince of Spain has besieged us.

1374
01:17:11,717 --> 01:17:14,119
Consequently, we
are surrounded.

1375
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:17,082
- A fine war. Where
the besiegers are beseiged

1376
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,183
and starve to death.

1377
01:17:18,223 --> 01:17:20,154
Yes, but the Marshal has
devised a brilliant plan

1378
01:17:20,194 --> 01:17:21,646
for bringing in food
this very night.

1379
01:17:21,676 --> 01:17:22,627
Now, see here.

1380
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:24,408
Spare us the details, Colonel.

1381
01:17:24,438 --> 01:17:26,990
Merely inform us
when the food arrives.

1382
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:29,553
True, we are hungry.
But why blame me?

1383
01:17:29,873 --> 01:17:31,494
I'm only your Colonel.

1384
01:17:32,876 --> 01:17:35,087
Oh, yes, I know
you disprove of me.

1385
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:37,119
Call me courtier, politician.

1386
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:40,262
Well, I can afford you little hates.

1387
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:42,914
My conduct under fire
is well known.

1388
01:17:42,944 --> 01:17:45,356
It was only yesterday
I repelled a Spanish attack.

1389
01:17:45,386 --> 01:17:47,258
Pouring my men down
like an avalanche.

1390
01:17:47,438 --> 01:17:48,900
I, myself lead the charge.

1391
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:51,522
And your white scarf?

1392
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:52,323
Cyrano!

1393
01:17:56,076 --> 01:17:57,337
And your white scarf?

1394
01:17:57,347 --> 01:17:58,678
Eh, you heard that episode?

1395
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:02,311
Yes, I was so far in advance
I was in danger of being captured.

1396
01:18:02,381 --> 01:18:04,773
But I thought quickly,
took off and flung away

1397
01:18:04,803 --> 01:18:06,495
the scarf that marked
my military rank.

1398
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:09,357
And so being inconspicuous
escaped among my own force,

1399
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,460
rallied them, returned,
and won the day.

1400
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,711
What do you say to that?

1401
01:18:13,751 --> 01:18:16,764
Still, an officer does not like
to resign the privilege of being a target.

1402
01:18:16,794 --> 01:18:19,907
How pleasant for you
that you are denied that privilege.

1403
01:18:19,947 --> 01:18:21,868
Pleasant?
Lend me your scarf.

1404
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:23,790
With your permission I shall
lead the first charge tonight

1405
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,111
wearing it over my shoulder.

1406
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:25,942
What bluster.

1407
01:18:25,972 --> 01:18:27,854
You're safe making that offer,
and you know it.

1408
01:18:27,894 --> 01:18:30,846
My scarf lies on the
river bank between the lines.

1409
01:18:30,876 --> 01:18:33,789
A spot swept by artillery.
Impossible to reach alive.

1410
01:18:33,929 --> 01:18:34,930
Yes.

1411
01:18:39,754 --> 01:18:40,645
Here.

1412
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:44,738
Thank you.

1413
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,242
This bit of white is
what I need to make a signal.

1414
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:51,604
I was hesitating.

1415
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:53,967
You have decided me.

1416
01:18:59,621 --> 01:19:01,263
- Stand or I'll fire!
- Hold you fire.

1417
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,904
There's a man down
there running away.

1418
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:05,756
Yes, a Spaniard.

1419
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:09,369
But very useful as a spy
to both sides.

1420
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:11,541
As I was about
to tell you.

1421
01:19:11,701 --> 01:19:14,164
The Marshal has withdrawn
more than half our forces here.

1422
01:19:14,204 --> 01:19:16,255
Fortunately, the Spaniards
do not know that.

1423
01:19:16,295 --> 01:19:19,538
Oh, yes, they do now,
and they will attack tonight.

1424
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:21,310
At this point.

1425
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,592
Your revenge, eh?

1426
01:19:23,622 --> 01:19:25,744
I make not great
pretense in loving you.

1427
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:29,247
But since you gentlemen
esteem yourselves invincible,

1428
01:19:29,277 --> 01:19:31,789
the bravest of the brave,
and all that.

1429
01:19:31,829 --> 01:19:33,200
Why need we be personal.

1430
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,792
The Marshal needs
a diversion, and I serve him

1431
01:19:35,823 --> 01:19:38,125
in choosing as I chose.

1432
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:40,527
As you can see, Captain,
the great thing is to gain time.

1433
01:19:40,557 --> 01:19:42,158
To hold until the Marshal returns.

1434
01:19:42,268 --> 01:19:44,070
And to gain time?

1435
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:50,465
You will all be so kind
as to lay down your lives.

1436
01:19:58,713 --> 01:19:59,804
Christian?

1437
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:00,904
Yes.

1438
01:20:04,067 --> 01:20:05,238
Roxane?

1439
01:20:06,049 --> 01:20:08,371
I should like to say
farewell to her

1440
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:10,693
with my whole
heart for her to keep.

1441
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:14,727
I have taken the liberty of...

1442
01:20:23,404 --> 01:20:24,235
But, wait.

1443
01:20:26,397 --> 01:20:27,308
This little spot.

1444
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:28,489
Spot?

1445
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:29,229
Yes.

1446
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,681
A tear.

1447
01:20:32,632 --> 01:20:33,343
Is nothing.

1448
01:20:33,383 --> 01:20:35,995
A poet while he writes
is like a lover in his lady's arms,

1449
01:20:36,025 --> 01:20:38,197
believing his imagination,
everything seems real.

1450
01:20:38,227 --> 01:20:39,849
There's half the charm
of writing.

1451
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:43,141
Now, I made this letter
so pathetic, that,

1452
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:46,434
while I was writing it,
I wept.

1453
01:20:46,464 --> 01:20:47,255
You wept?

1454
01:20:47,796 --> 01:20:50,738
Why, yes, because
it is a little thing to die,

1455
01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:55,863
but not to see her,...
that is terrible.

1456
01:20:56,853 --> 01:21:01,047
I shall never...,
you will never...

1457
01:21:01,638 --> 01:21:02,849
Give me that.

1458
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:07,663
- Halt. Who goes there.
- On the service of the King.

1459
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:20,504
- The King!
- Fall in...

1460
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:30,803
Good evening.

1461
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:32,725
On the King's service, you?

1462
01:21:42,594 --> 01:21:45,046
- Gentlemen,...
- What are you doing here?

1463
01:21:45,086 --> 01:21:47,498
- We heard rumors at home
you were hungry,

1464
01:21:47,538 --> 01:21:49,009
so we came prepared.

1465
01:21:49,049 --> 01:21:53,703
The Spaniards adored the fare,
but they missed the fowl!

1466
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:06,234
But why did you come here
into this, this danger?

1467
01:22:06,274 --> 01:22:08,636
They said in Paris
there was no fighting.

1468
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:12,840
Besides, it was your own fault.

1469
01:22:20,637 --> 01:22:22,999
Think of the
letters you have written me.

1470
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:25,741
How many times!
Every day!

1471
01:22:25,781 --> 01:22:26,912
Every day?

1472
01:22:26,952 --> 01:22:28,053
Of course.

1473
01:22:28,213 --> 01:22:30,796
And each one
more wonderful than the last.

1474
01:22:30,836 --> 01:22:34,059
All this, for a few absurd love letters.

1475
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:37,291
Hush. Absurd?
Your letters...no, never.

1476
01:22:38,272 --> 01:22:41,976
Every one was like hearing your voice
that night in the dark. Remember?

1477
01:22:42,006 --> 01:22:45,839
Like your arms around me.
I read them over and over.

1478
01:22:45,879 --> 01:22:49,672
Every page was like
a petal fallen from you soul.

1479
01:22:49,712 --> 01:22:52,605
Like the light
and the fire of a great love.

1480
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:55,277
- Sweet and strong and true.
- Sweet.

1481
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:56,538
Strong.

1482
01:22:56,849 --> 01:22:57,749
True?

1483
01:23:00,832 --> 01:23:02,353
Oh, my Christian.

1484
01:23:02,954 --> 01:23:05,686
I came here to ask forgiveness.

1485
01:23:06,927 --> 01:23:08,649
It is time to be forgiven.

1486
01:23:09,129 --> 01:23:11,221
Now, when we
may die so soon.

1487
01:23:13,053 --> 01:23:14,654
Forgive me for being
light and vain

1488
01:23:14,684 --> 01:23:16,846
and loving you only
because you were handsome.

1489
01:23:16,876 --> 01:23:18,508
- For now...
- Now?

1490
01:23:19,358 --> 01:23:21,220
I love you for yourself.

1491
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,372
For what you are.

1492
01:23:23,402 --> 01:23:24,623
Roxane.

1493
01:23:25,193 --> 01:23:28,286
How you must have suffered.
For you saw how frivolous I was.

1494
01:23:28,316 --> 01:23:30,588
And to be loved
for the mere costume,

1495
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:33,381
for the poor, casual
body you went about in.

1496
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,914
To a soul like yours,
that must have been torture.

1497
01:23:36,944 --> 01:23:37,684
No.

1498
01:23:41,297 --> 01:23:42,438
I understand.

1499
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:45,231
You cannot perfectly
believe in me,

1500
01:23:45,261 --> 01:23:46,832
a...a love like this...

1501
01:23:46,862 --> 01:23:48,394
I want no love like this.

1502
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:50,325
I want love only for...

1503
01:23:50,355 --> 01:23:52,397
Only for what every
woman sees in you.

1504
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:54,339
I can to better than that.

1505
01:23:54,369 --> 01:23:56,551
No, it...it was best before.

1506
01:23:57,672 --> 01:23:59,403
You do not
altogether know me.

1507
01:23:59,854 --> 01:24:01,575
I was a child.

1508
01:24:01,665 --> 01:24:02,966
I'm a woman now.

1509
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:06,039
- If...if you were less handsome,
- No.

1510
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:09,452
unattractive, ugly even,
I should love you, still.

1511
01:24:10,093 --> 01:24:11,224
Do you mean that?

1512
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,075
I do mean that.

1513
01:24:13,245 --> 01:24:14,346
Ugly?

1514
01:24:14,427 --> 01:24:15,527
Even then.

1515
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:17,379
Now, are you happy?

1516
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:23,985
Yes.

1517
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:24,836
What is it?

1518
01:24:25,526 --> 01:24:28,028
Nothing, only, Cyrano...

1519
01:24:29,059 --> 01:24:30,170
Cyrano.

1520
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:33,433
he has something
to tell you.

1521
01:24:35,525 --> 01:24:36,546
Where are you going?

1522
01:24:36,586 --> 01:24:40,039
I...will...return...in a moment.

1523
01:24:48,556 --> 01:24:49,407
Cyrano.

1524
01:24:50,008 --> 01:24:51,839
Your wife, sir,
she goes with me?

1525
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:52,700
No, sir, she remains.

1526
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:54,031
There is still time
for her to escape.

1527
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:55,002
She stays!

1528
01:24:55,392 --> 01:24:56,153
Very well.

1529
01:24:56,183 --> 01:24:58,315
Someone give me a musket.
I stay here also.

1530
01:24:58,785 --> 01:25:00,006
Sir, you show courage.

1531
01:25:00,036 --> 01:25:02,258
What, shall I run away,
and leave a woman?

1532
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:04,691
Colonel, my compliments, sir.

1533
01:25:06,172 --> 01:25:07,183
What of Roxane?

1534
01:25:07,213 --> 01:25:08,244
Wait.

1535
01:25:08,724 --> 01:25:10,235
Well, what is it?
You look so...

1536
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,959
She does not love me.

1537
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:16,691
- You think not?
- She loves you.

1538
01:25:16,721 --> 01:25:19,013
- No.
- She loves only my soul.

1539
01:25:19,043 --> 01:25:19,754
- No.
- Yes!

1540
01:25:19,784 --> 01:25:22,526
That means you.
And you love her.

1541
01:25:22,556 --> 01:25:24,688
- I?
- I see. I know.

1542
01:25:24,728 --> 01:25:27,701
You wrote her,
everyday, every day!

1543
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:29,422
- Perfectly simple.
- Simple?

1544
01:25:29,452 --> 01:25:31,094
For a month,
we've been blockaded here.

1545
01:25:31,134 --> 01:25:32,735
How did you send
all those letters?

1546
01:25:32,765 --> 01:25:33,896
Before daylight
I managed...

1547
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,467
To face death
everyday.

1548
01:25:36,218 --> 01:25:37,349
You love her.

1549
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:39,591
Yes.

1550
01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:47,298
Tell her so.

1551
01:25:47,328 --> 01:25:48,659
- No.
- Why not?

1552
01:25:48,759 --> 01:25:51,702
Why?
Look at me.

1553
01:25:52,002 --> 01:25:54,834
She would love me
if I were ugly.

1554
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:58,237
- She said that?
- Yes. Now, go to her.

1555
01:25:59,509 --> 01:26:01,831
Nonsense. Do not
believe any such madness.

1556
01:26:01,861 --> 01:26:04,153
Go back to her.
You never will be ugly.

1557
01:26:04,183 --> 01:26:05,234
Go!
It is you she loves.

1558
01:26:05,274 --> 01:26:06,294
That is what
we shall see.

1559
01:26:06,325 --> 01:26:07,265
No, no!

1560
01:26:07,305 --> 01:26:08,907
- Let her chose between us.
- No.

1561
01:26:08,947 --> 01:26:10,939
- Tell her everything.
- Why do you torture me?

1562
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:14,131
Shall I ruin your happiness,
because I was born with a pretty face?

1563
01:26:14,171 --> 01:26:16,644
Am I to ruin yours,
because I happen to have power

1564
01:26:16,684 --> 01:26:18,185
to say what you perhaps feel?

1565
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:20,347
- Tell her!
- Don't drive me too far!

1566
01:26:20,387 --> 01:26:22,649
- I'm tired of being my own rival.
- Hard to know.

1567
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:24,911
My secret marriage, that
can be annulled, I expect.

1568
01:26:24,941 --> 01:26:27,233
I want her love
for the poor fool than I am,

1569
01:26:27,303 --> 01:26:28,464
or not at all.

1570
01:26:28,834 --> 01:26:31,537
Oh, I'm going through with this.
I'll know one way or the other.

1571
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:34,729
Now, go!...Tell her.

1572
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,241
Let her chose one of us.

1573
01:26:37,021 --> 01:26:38,232
It will be you.

1574
01:26:39,123 --> 01:26:40,785
I hope so.

1575
01:26:52,535 --> 01:26:53,286
Captain!

1576
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:57,569
The Spanish fires are going out.

1577
01:27:00,502 --> 01:27:01,633
It begins.

1578
01:27:01,693 --> 01:27:03,615
I need a scout. Where's Cyrano.

1579
01:27:03,965 --> 01:27:04,756
Captain.

1580
01:27:05,326 --> 01:27:06,217
Let me go.

1581
01:27:06,257 --> 01:27:08,969
No, my boy, Cyrano knows
the terrain. He knows their lines.

1582
01:27:09,009 --> 01:27:11,031
So do I.
Please, allow me.

1583
01:27:13,643 --> 01:27:15,555
Very well.
We must know from which

1584
01:27:15,595 --> 01:27:18,298
direction the advance comes.
Their weight and numbers.

1585
01:27:18,328 --> 01:27:19,048
I understand.

1586
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:32,280
Roxane.

1587
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:33,951
Cyrano.

1588
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:35,433
Christian thinks...

1589
01:27:36,974 --> 01:27:38,695
Christian thinks you
ought to know that...

1590
01:27:38,725 --> 01:27:39,746
But I do know.

1591
01:27:40,277 --> 01:27:42,359
He still doubts what I
just told him, just now.

1592
01:27:42,389 --> 01:27:43,370
I saw that.

1593
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:47,073
Yes, but,...was it true,
what you told him just now?

1594
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:48,414
It was true.

1595
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:51,787
I said that I should love him,
even if he were...

1596
01:27:52,538 --> 01:27:54,099
The word comes
hard before me?

1597
01:27:56,941 --> 01:27:58,383
Say it, I shall
not be hurt.

1598
01:27:58,893 --> 01:28:00,144
Ugly?

1599
01:28:00,204 --> 01:28:01,656
Even, then
I should love him.

1600
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,218
Disfigured.

1601
01:28:04,248 --> 01:28:05,399
Or disfigured.

1602
01:28:06,009 --> 01:28:09,152
Even...grotesque.

1603
01:28:09,182 --> 01:28:10,884
How could he
every be grotesque,

1604
01:28:11,344 --> 01:28:12,485
ever to me?

1605
01:28:12,525 --> 01:28:15,117
But, you could love him so,
as much as?

1606
01:28:15,147 --> 01:28:16,328
Yes, and more.

1607
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:17,860
Roxane...

1608
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:19,801
What is it?

1609
01:28:21,093 --> 01:28:22,143
Are they fighting?

1610
01:28:24,796 --> 01:28:26,057
What is happening?

1611
01:28:26,227 --> 01:28:27,558
The Spaniards advance,

1612
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:29,480
but there is time.

1613
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:31,922
- Where is Christian?
- At the parapet.

1614
01:28:32,372 --> 01:28:33,443
Oh, of course.

1615
01:28:34,484 --> 01:28:36,306
What is it
that you wish to tell me?

1616
01:28:36,336 --> 01:28:37,697
Roxane,...

1617
01:28:38,368 --> 01:28:41,250
believe me this is difficult,
and for once I lack words.

1618
01:28:44,253 --> 01:28:45,894
Christian asked me to...

1619
01:28:46,004 --> 01:28:47,416
He told me...

1620
01:28:56,614 --> 01:28:57,795
Christian!

1621
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:02,549
To your places, gentlemen.

1622
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:04,711
Is he dead?

1623
01:29:04,751 --> 01:29:05,842
No, but dying.

1624
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,243
I will not let him!

1625
01:29:11,457 --> 01:29:14,119
Cyrano...did you?

1626
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,201
Yes, my friend.
I have told her.

1627
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:19,043
She loves you.

1628
01:29:20,435 --> 01:29:21,786
Roxane.

1629
01:29:21,836 --> 01:29:23,167
Yes, my darling.

1630
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:26,920
Christian!

1631
01:29:27,771 --> 01:29:28,972
He is not dead?

1632
01:29:30,533 --> 01:29:31,434
Yes.

1633
01:29:41,253 --> 01:29:42,504
Time you must go, now.

1634
01:29:42,934 --> 01:29:45,476
Really, he is dead.

1635
01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:47,358
No one else
knew him but you.

1636
01:29:47,869 --> 01:29:49,250
Was he not a hero?

1637
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:50,321
Yes, Roxane.

1638
01:29:51,141 --> 01:29:52,963
A heart deeper
than we knew.

1639
01:29:53,003 --> 01:29:54,554
Yes, Roxane.

1640
01:29:54,634 --> 01:29:58,938
A poet.
A soul magnificently tender.

1641
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:03,292
Yes, Roxane.

1642
01:30:04,473 --> 01:30:06,375
But he is dead now.

1643
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:10,869
Why, so am I.

1644
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,702
For I am dead
and my love mourns for me

1645
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,193
and does not know.

1646
01:30:17,835 --> 01:30:19,176
Will never know.

1647
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:23,680
Take her away quickly.

1648
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:26,152
Wait.

1649
01:30:27,293 --> 01:30:28,874
A letter over his heart.

1650
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:38,123
I have two deaths
to avenge, now,

1651
01:30:38,753 --> 01:30:42,336
Christian's...and my own.

1652
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:09,970
Fire!

1653
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:22,511
Surrender or you die!

1654
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,745
Ah!

1655
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,423
We fought. We died.
We fought again.

1656
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:32,575
Who are these men who are
so fond of death, one Spaniard cried.

1657
01:33:32,655 --> 01:33:34,257
On and on, they came.

1658
01:33:34,387 --> 01:33:37,029
Then, when all seemed lost,
we heard the trumpets

1659
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:39,672
of our returning troops.
The battle was ours!

1660
01:33:40,512 --> 01:33:43,875
Ah, you have been fortunate,
Ms. de Bergerac, you have lived!

1661
01:33:43,915 --> 01:33:48,699
While we, we waste our youth.
There is no war and not hope for any.

1662
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:50,711
No hope for any?

1663
01:33:51,352 --> 01:33:54,054
My fellow, I just realize,
we are both fools.

1664
01:33:54,465 --> 01:33:57,387
But mine is the greater folly,
for I am an older fool.

1665
01:33:58,008 --> 01:34:02,161
What is more...
Everything I told you was a lie.

1666
01:34:07,396 --> 01:34:09,528
Another satire
for the Gazette?

1667
01:34:09,558 --> 01:34:10,258
Yes.

1668
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:13,331
Another glove flung
in the face of power?

1669
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:15,253
Oh, why do you
do it, Cyrano?

1670
01:34:15,283 --> 01:34:17,715
- Why do you attack...
- Stupidity?

1671
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:21,038
Deceit? Corruption?
I'm too old to change.

1672
01:34:21,228 --> 01:34:23,840
I'm an old dog
with nothing left but his teeth.

1673
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:26,443
Ah, but teeth can be pulled.
That can be painful.

1674
01:34:30,306 --> 01:34:34,450
That insolent wretch.
That scoundrel de Bergerac.

1675
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:37,052
This time he's gone too far.
I swear it.

1676
01:34:37,082 --> 01:34:38,663
He's signed his death warrant.

1677
01:34:39,824 --> 01:34:41,606
And who will deliver it?

1678
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:44,919
His sword is still very
powerful, my friend.

1679
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:47,111
There are may ways
a man can die.

1680
01:34:47,871 --> 01:34:49,433
Who knows?

1681
01:34:49,763 --> 01:34:51,314
He may meet
with an accident.

1682
01:34:52,435 --> 01:34:53,456
Soon.

1683
01:35:04,136 --> 01:35:05,957
But, uh, tell me, Madame.

1684
01:35:06,077 --> 01:35:10,731
How long will you continue
to remain here, forever in mourning?

1685
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:12,473
Forever.

1686
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:14,985
Was Christian all that?

1687
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:17,307
If you knew him
you would not ask.

1688
01:35:17,858 --> 01:35:20,060
His last letter
is still in my heart.

1689
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:24,684
And, uh, Cyrano?
Do you see him often?

1690
01:35:24,834 --> 01:35:29,157
Every week. My old friend
takes the place of my Gazette.

1691
01:35:29,538 --> 01:35:31,239
He brings me all the news.

1692
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,862
Every Saturday under
that tree out there.

1693
01:35:34,903 --> 01:35:36,994
I wait for him embroidering.

1694
01:35:37,355 --> 01:35:40,167
The hour strikes.
I need not turn to look.

1695
01:35:40,497 --> 01:35:44,000
At the last stroke,
I hear his cane tapping the walk.

1696
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,363
His satires have made
him many enemies.

1697
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:49,675
But, they still fear
that sword of his.

1698
01:35:50,266 --> 01:35:52,068
No one dare touch him.

1699
01:35:52,448 --> 01:35:53,609
Hm, that may be so.

1700
01:35:55,561 --> 01:35:58,103
It is not violence
I fear for him,

1701
01:35:58,143 --> 01:36:02,507
but solitude, poverty.
Old gray Decembers

1702
01:36:02,537 --> 01:36:05,299
stealing on wolf's feet
into his darkened room.

1703
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,182
It seems to me he's
worn the same old coat

1704
01:36:08,212 --> 01:36:09,563
for many months, now.

1705
01:36:09,603 --> 01:36:11,695
Eh, that is nothing
strange in this world.

1706
01:36:11,735 --> 01:36:13,777
You need not pity
him overmuch.

1707
01:36:13,817 --> 01:36:16,889
He lives his life,
his own life his own way,

1708
01:36:16,929 --> 01:36:20,262
thought, word and deed free.

1709
01:36:20,412 --> 01:36:21,573
My Lord Duke.

1710
01:36:21,714 --> 01:36:25,827
Oh, yes, I know.
I have all. He has nothing.

1711
01:36:26,338 --> 01:36:32,143
Nevertheless, today,
I should be proud to shake his hand.

1712
01:36:32,323 --> 01:36:33,974
Ah, well, adieu.

1713
01:36:34,645 --> 01:36:36,276
Will I ever see you again?

1714
01:36:36,316 --> 01:36:37,948
Come whenever you like.

1715
01:36:37,988 --> 01:36:39,589
Then, you have forgiven me.

1716
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,661
I am here.

1717
01:36:42,932 --> 01:36:45,364
Do you know?
When a man wins

1718
01:36:45,404 --> 01:36:49,738
everything in this world,
when he succeeds too much,

1719
01:36:49,778 --> 01:36:54,182
he feels, somehow,
a thousand small displeasures

1720
01:36:54,222 --> 01:36:58,556
with himself, whose whole sum
is not quite remorse

1721
01:36:58,596 --> 01:37:05,572
but rather a sort of vague
disgust, dry illusions, pained regrets.

1722
01:37:05,872 --> 01:37:08,735
Yes, now and then,
I envy your Cyrano.

1723
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:10,867
The sentiment
does you honor.

1724
01:37:19,364 --> 01:37:24,298
Madame, I must tell you,
it is true that no one has yet

1725
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,510
dared to attack
your friend Cyrano.

1726
01:37:26,821 --> 01:37:31,405
Nevertheless, at the theater
last night, I heard some things.

1727
01:37:32,285 --> 01:37:33,747
Keep him at home all you can.

1728
01:37:34,117 --> 01:37:37,360
Tomorrow when you see him,
tell him to be careful.

1729
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:39,161
I thank you.

1730
01:37:52,093 --> 01:37:53,184
Good night, Ragueneau.

1731
01:37:53,224 --> 01:37:55,165
Cyrano, you not leaving?

1732
01:37:55,195 --> 01:37:57,077
You will not have
dinner here with me?

1733
01:37:57,107 --> 01:37:58,909
My regrets. I have a magnificent

1734
01:37:58,949 --> 01:38:02,502
roast waiting for me, a rare wine,
a gift from my publisher.

1735
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:03,943
Fine, to be sure.

1736
01:38:04,704 --> 01:38:07,546
Uh, have you seen
Moliere's new play?

1737
01:38:07,586 --> 01:38:08,317
No.

1738
01:38:08,397 --> 01:38:09,708
Heh, ah, well...

1739
01:38:09,748 --> 01:38:10,639
What is it?

1740
01:38:10,669 --> 01:38:11,520
Well, he...

1741
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,310
Speak.

1742
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:15,283
He stole a scene
from you, word for word.

1743
01:38:15,313 --> 01:38:17,205
You know, "What the devil
was he doing there?"

1744
01:38:17,235 --> 01:38:17,995
That one.

1745
01:38:18,035 --> 01:38:19,106
He stole it, bodily.

1746
01:38:19,136 --> 01:38:21,368
Well, he showed
good taste.

1747
01:38:21,408 --> 01:38:23,090
It, uh, played well?

1748
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:25,522
Oh, beautifully. They
laughed and laughed.

1749
01:38:25,552 --> 01:38:26,883
Oh, how they laughed.

1750
01:38:27,324 --> 01:38:28,635
Moliere has genius.

1751
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:31,087
Christian had good looks.

1752
01:38:32,248 --> 01:38:33,689
With me, it was
always thus.

1753
01:38:36,131 --> 01:38:37,322
Good night, my friend.

1754
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:53,146
Hold, there.

1755
01:38:53,256 --> 01:38:54,047
You!

1756
01:38:55,748 --> 01:38:56,949
Are you addressing me?

1757
01:38:56,979 --> 01:38:59,091
Yes, you, Monsieur
of the long nose.

1758
01:38:59,201 --> 01:39:00,102
Insolence.

1759
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:02,094
- Foulmouthed scribbler.
- What?

1760
01:39:02,124 --> 01:39:03,545
- Lair, plagiarist!
- Liar.

1761
01:39:47,714 --> 01:39:48,635
Doctor.

1762
01:39:50,076 --> 01:39:51,407
Why pretend?

1763
01:39:51,697 --> 01:39:53,059
It is very grave.

1764
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:55,651
Keep him quiet
at all costs.

1765
01:39:55,691 --> 01:39:58,654
If he attempts
to rise, he will die.

1766
01:39:58,694 --> 01:39:59,965
Shhhh.

1767
01:40:03,378 --> 01:40:04,088
Thank you.

1768
01:40:22,204 --> 01:40:23,845
Monsieur.

1769
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:24,636
Ah, Sister.

1770
01:40:31,682 --> 01:40:33,033
What is the matter
with you?

1771
01:40:35,165 --> 01:40:36,586
Shall I tell you
something, Sister?

1772
01:40:37,227 --> 01:40:41,160
Yesterday, Friday, mind you,
I ate meat again.

1773
01:40:42,622 --> 01:40:43,693
Yes, I know.

1774
01:40:44,043 --> 01:40:45,774
That is why you
are so pale.

1775
01:40:45,814 --> 01:40:48,627
Please come to me
to the refectory before you go.

1776
01:40:48,657 --> 01:40:50,949
I'll make you a great
bowl of hot soup.

1777
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:52,330
Of course, of course.

1778
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,652
You're quite reasonable today.

1779
01:40:54,692 --> 01:40:56,824
Perhaps you'll convert me.

1780
01:40:56,864 --> 01:40:58,966
Oh, no! Not for the world.

1781
01:40:59,626 --> 01:41:01,398
Why, now I think of it,
that is so.

1782
01:41:01,778 --> 01:41:05,271
You, bursting with holiness,
and yet you never preach.

1783
01:41:06,182 --> 01:41:07,473
Astonishing.

1784
01:41:07,774 --> 01:41:09,815
And now I shall astonish you.

1785
01:41:10,406 --> 01:41:14,830
I'm going to let you
pray for me tonight, at Vespers.

1786
01:41:16,551 --> 01:41:19,424
Absolutely struck dumb, eh?

1787
01:41:23,277 --> 01:41:25,909
I did not wait for you
to say I might.

1788
01:41:35,668 --> 01:41:38,190
Now may the devil admire
me if never hope to see

1789
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:40,312
the end of that embroidery.

1790
01:41:40,342 --> 01:41:44,185
After 14 years,
late for the first time.

1791
01:41:44,226 --> 01:41:47,298
Yes.
Yes, maddening.

1792
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:52,233
I was detained by
a visitor. Most unexpected.

1793
01:41:52,903 --> 01:41:54,414
An old friend of mine.

1794
01:41:55,295 --> 01:41:57,587
At least a very
old acquaintance.

1795
01:41:57,627 --> 01:41:59,079
Did you tell him
to go away?

1796
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:01,170
For the time being, yes.

1797
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:06,035
I said excuse me,
I see that it's Saturday,

1798
01:42:06,385 --> 01:42:08,967
I have a previous
engagement.

1799
01:42:09,007 --> 01:42:10,388
One I cannot miss.

1800
01:42:11,089 --> 01:42:13,111
Even for you.

1801
01:42:14,022 --> 01:42:16,083
Come back an hour from now.

1802
01:42:16,194 --> 01:42:19,947
Your friend will have to wait.
I shall not let you go till dark.

1803
01:42:21,018 --> 01:42:25,752
Perhaps a little before dark,
I must go.

1804
01:42:25,782 --> 01:42:29,866
Oh, then tell me now
the court news. My Gazette.

1805
01:42:31,177 --> 01:42:34,980
Ah, yes, well, let me see.

1806
01:42:37,142 --> 01:42:41,636
Saturday, 19th, the King
fell ill after eight helpings of

1807
01:42:41,676 --> 01:42:42,967
grape marmalade.

1808
01:42:43,678 --> 01:42:47,121
Grape marmalade will
no longer be served at court.

1809
01:42:48,992 --> 01:42:53,816
Sunday, the royal pulse
is now normal.

1810
01:42:55,438 --> 01:42:58,741
Monday, everyone was
talking about the success

1811
01:42:58,771 --> 01:43:00,412
of Moliere's new play.

1812
01:43:01,643 --> 01:43:06,928
Tuesday, the King fell ill
after six helpings of marone glacee.

1813
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,951
Marone glacee will no
longer be served at court.

1814
01:43:12,533 --> 01:43:16,526
Wednesday, the Compte de Firske
spoke to Madame de Monte Glas.

1815
01:43:17,327 --> 01:43:20,210
She said...no.

1816
01:43:22,311 --> 01:43:28,287
Thursday... Nothing.

1817
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:31,419
Friday, Madame de Monte Glas
said yes.

1818
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:39,647
Saturday, 25th...

1819
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:41,368
Cyrano!

1820
01:43:42,169 --> 01:43:44,861
What is it?
Cyrano!

1821
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:52,158
- Oh, no, no, it is nothing.
- What?

1822
01:43:52,608 --> 01:43:55,060
The old wound at Arras
sometimes...

1823
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:57,843
- My poor friend.
- No, no, no, it is nothing.

1824
01:43:58,693 --> 01:44:00,215
It will soon be gone.

1825
01:44:01,876 --> 01:44:05,860
There. 'Tis gone.

1826
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:09,353
We all have
our old wounds.

1827
01:44:09,893 --> 01:44:14,797
I have mine here,
under this faded scrap of writing.

1828
01:44:16,259 --> 01:44:18,220
It's hard to read now.

1829
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:22,224
All for the blots
and tears.

1830
01:44:22,254 --> 01:44:23,445
His letter?

1831
01:44:24,366 --> 01:44:27,539
Did you not promise me,
that someday you would let me read it?

1832
01:44:27,979 --> 01:44:33,244
- This letter? You wish...?
- I do wish it...today.

1833
01:44:43,553 --> 01:44:45,134
Open it and read.

1834
01:45:10,626 --> 01:45:15,591
"Farewell, Roxane,
because today I die."

1835
01:45:15,621 --> 01:45:16,932
Aloud?

1836
01:45:18,113 --> 01:45:21,085
"I know that it will be today,
my own dearly beloved.

1837
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:25,840
"Yet, my heart still so heavy
with love I have not told.

1838
01:45:27,381 --> 01:45:32,275
"And I shall die without telling you.

1839
01:45:32,846 --> 01:45:36,689
"No more shall my eyes
drink the sight of you like wine,

1840
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:40,132
"never more with a look
that is a kiss,

1841
01:45:40,693 --> 01:45:43,385
"follow the sweet
grace of you."

1842
01:45:43,425 --> 01:45:45,357
How you read it.
His letter.

1843
01:45:45,397 --> 01:45:47,258
"I remember now the way you have

1844
01:45:47,298 --> 01:45:51,242
"of pushing back a lock of hair
with one hand from your forehead,

1845
01:45:51,822 --> 01:45:54,235
- "and my heart cries out..."
- His letter!

1846
01:45:54,275 --> 01:45:55,966
"cries out and keeps crying."

1847
01:45:56,006 --> 01:45:59,209
- You read it so...
- "Farewell, my dear, my dearest,"

1848
01:45:59,239 --> 01:46:01,621
- In a voice...
- "my own heart's own,"

1849
01:46:01,651 --> 01:46:05,204
- "my own treasure," - In
such a voice! - "my...love."

1850
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:08,117
Yes, I remember hearing long ago.

1851
01:46:08,467 --> 01:46:13,191
"I am never away from you.
Even now I shall not leave you.

1852
01:46:14,092 --> 01:46:17,345
"In another world, I shall
still be that one who loves you,

1853
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:21,098
"loves you beyond measure,
beyond..."

1854
01:46:30,176 --> 01:46:32,128
But, how can you read it now?

1855
01:46:35,421 --> 01:46:38,814
And all those 14 years
he has been the old friend

1856
01:46:38,844 --> 01:46:40,655
who came to me to be amusing.

1857
01:46:41,936 --> 01:46:44,178
- Roxane.
- It was you.

1858
01:46:44,919 --> 01:46:45,890
No, no, Roxane, no.

1859
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:49,113
And I might have know it every time
that I heard you speak my name.

1860
01:46:49,143 --> 01:46:52,706
- No, it was not I. -
It was you! - I swear.

1861
01:46:53,476 --> 01:46:55,828
- The letters. That was you.
- No.

1862
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:59,982
- And the dear foolish words. That was you.
- No.

1863
01:47:00,212 --> 01:47:04,316
- And the voice in the dark. That was you.
- On my honor!

1864
01:47:04,356 --> 01:47:08,199
And the soul.
It was all you.

1865
01:47:08,299 --> 01:47:10,211
I never loved you.

1866
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:11,883
Yes, you loved me.

1867
01:47:12,003 --> 01:47:13,774
Even now you love me.

1868
01:47:14,695 --> 01:47:16,647
No!

1869
01:47:16,687 --> 01:47:18,959
And twice you're great to know.

1870
01:47:18,989 --> 01:47:21,801
Oh, no, no, my own dear love,
I love you not.

1871
01:47:24,383 --> 01:47:26,886
Why were you silent
for so many years?

1872
01:47:27,626 --> 01:47:28,907
All the while.

1873
01:47:29,138 --> 01:47:32,160
Every night, and every day,
he gave me nothing.

1874
01:47:32,931 --> 01:47:34,172
You knew that.

1875
01:47:34,773 --> 01:47:37,735
You knew in that letter
lying on my breast.

1876
01:47:38,996 --> 01:47:40,287
Your tears.

1877
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:43,830
You knew they
were your tears.

1878
01:47:47,454 --> 01:47:49,335
The blood was his.

1879
01:47:50,436 --> 01:47:51,267
Cyrano!

1880
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:55,391
Here! He's here.

1881
01:47:55,461 --> 01:47:56,742
Oh, what recklessness.

1882
01:47:56,882 --> 01:47:57,643
No.

1883
01:47:57,673 --> 01:47:58,503
I knew it!

1884
01:47:58,563 --> 01:48:01,516
- Madame he has killed himself coming here.
- No. Shh.

1885
01:48:01,776 --> 01:48:03,298
That drink is, what is it?

1886
01:48:03,368 --> 01:48:06,590
Nothing. I did not
finish my Gazette.

1887
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:11,054
Saturday, 26th, an hour
or so before dinner

1888
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:16,429
Ms. de Bergerac died,
foully murdered.

1889
01:48:16,779 --> 01:48:18,561
Cyrano, what have
they done to you?

1890
01:48:18,691 --> 01:48:20,633
How fate loves a jest.

1891
01:48:21,073 --> 01:48:24,096
Behold me ambushed,
taken unawares.

1892
01:48:24,256 --> 01:48:29,931
My noble foe, a lackey.
My battlefield, a gutter.

1893
01:48:30,591 --> 01:48:32,053
It seems too logical.

1894
01:48:32,473 --> 01:48:34,145
They have missed everything,

1895
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:36,397
even my death.

1896
01:48:37,437 --> 01:48:39,059
Sisters! Sisters!

1897
01:48:39,099 --> 01:48:42,462
No, do not go away.
I may not be here when you return.

1898
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,874
You shall not die.

1899
01:48:44,914 --> 01:48:46,575
I love you.

1900
01:48:46,605 --> 01:48:48,527
No, my lady,
it's not in the story.

1901
01:48:49,218 --> 01:48:51,019
When beauty said
I love you to the beast

1902
01:48:51,049 --> 01:48:54,112
all his ugliness changed
and dissolved, like magic.

1903
01:48:54,673 --> 01:48:58,496
But, you see,
I am still the same.

1904
01:48:58,566 --> 01:49:00,558
And I have
done this to you.

1905
01:49:00,598 --> 01:49:01,749
You? Why no.

1906
01:49:01,929 --> 01:49:03,190
All my fault, mine!

1907
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:04,451
On the contrary.

1908
01:49:05,192 --> 01:49:08,214
I have never know womanhood
in its sweetness, but for you.

1909
01:49:09,856 --> 01:49:11,888
My mother did not
like to look at me.

1910
01:49:13,189 --> 01:49:14,670
I never had a sister.

1911
01:49:16,021 --> 01:49:22,277
Later, I feared those sweethearts
with mockery behind her smile.

1912
01:49:23,668 --> 01:49:27,301
But, because of you,
I have had across my life

1913
01:49:28,082 --> 01:49:31,755
one whispering, silken gown.

1914
01:49:33,937 --> 01:49:36,359
I never loved but
one man in my life.

1915
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:39,842
I have lost him, twice.

1916
01:49:44,736 --> 01:49:49,060
I would not have you mourning
any less that good, noble Christian.

1917
01:49:50,151 --> 01:49:53,744
But, perhaps, I ask only this,

1918
01:49:55,276 --> 01:49:57,548
when the great cold
gathers around my bones,

1919
01:49:58,949 --> 01:50:03,773
you may give a double
meaning to your widow's weeds.

1920
01:50:05,094 --> 01:50:11,390
The tears you let fall for him,
may for a little, be my tears.

1921
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:14,232
Oh, my love!

1922
01:50:17,595 --> 01:50:19,597
No, not here.
Not lying down.

1923
01:50:19,917 --> 01:50:22,499
Let no one help me.
No one need help me.

1924
01:50:27,514 --> 01:50:28,635
It is coming.

1925
01:50:29,466 --> 01:50:32,668
I feel already shod with marble.

1926
01:50:33,929 --> 01:50:35,161
Gloved with lead.

1927
01:50:35,941 --> 01:50:37,913
Very well,
let the old fellow come now.

1928
01:50:38,403 --> 01:50:40,815
He shall find me
on my feet.

1929
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:44,339
Sword in hand.

1930
01:50:44,379 --> 01:50:45,329
Cyrano!

1931
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,111
He'd delirious.

1932
01:50:47,982 --> 01:50:49,223
I see him now.

1933
01:50:49,263 --> 01:50:50,024
He grins.

1934
01:50:50,064 --> 01:50:51,975
He is looking at my nose!

1935
01:50:52,015 --> 01:50:53,046
That skeleton.

1936
01:50:53,827 --> 01:50:54,958
You there.

1937
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:55,899
Who are you?

1938
01:50:56,789 --> 01:50:58,181
A hundred against one, eh?

1939
01:50:58,531 --> 01:51:01,253
I know them now,
my ancient enemies.

1940
01:51:01,288 --> 01:51:02,194
Falsehood, there!

1941
01:51:02,474 --> 01:51:03,706
There, Predujice!

1942
01:51:03,726 --> 01:51:05,337
Compromise, Cowardice.

1943
01:51:05,817 --> 01:51:08,400
What's that?
Surrender? No, never!

1944
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:09,671
Never!

1945
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:12,063
Ah, you too, Vanity.

1946
01:51:12,283 --> 01:51:15,426
I knew you would
overthrow me in the end.

1947
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:18,559
No, I fight, I fight on,
I fight...ow!

1948
01:51:27,797 --> 01:51:29,808
All my laurels
you have riven away.

1949
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:33,031
And my roses.

1950
01:51:34,202 --> 01:51:36,865
Yet, in spite of you,
there is one crown

1951
01:51:36,895 --> 01:51:38,246
I made away with me.

1952
01:51:38,286 --> 01:51:41,649
And tonight when I
enter before God,

1953
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:48,415
my salute shall sweep away
the stars from the blue threshold.

1954
01:51:49,586 --> 01:51:54,520
One thing without stain,
unspotted from the world,

1955
01:51:55,521 --> 01:52:01,396
in spite of doom, mine own,
...and that is...

1956
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:09,213
my...white...plume...

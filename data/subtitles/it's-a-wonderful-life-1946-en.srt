Have you put
any real pressure

to pay those mortgages?

are out of work.
Well, then, foreclose.

what makes you such
a hard-skulled character?

no children.

to spend all the

I should give it
to miserable failures

You look tired.

345
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,266
Oh, I had another
tussle with
Potter today.

346
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,135
I thought when we put him
on the board of directors,

347
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,636
he'd ease up
on us a little bit.

348
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,172
Oh, what's eating
that old money-grubbing
buzzard anyway?

349
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:42,375
Oh, he's a sick man,
frustrated,
sick in his mind.

350
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,444
Sick in his soul,
if he has one.

351
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,280
He hates everybody
that has anything
that he can't have.

352
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,881
He hates us
mostly, I guess.

353
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,550
Gangway. Gangway.

354
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,019
So long, Pop.
So long.

355
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,920
You got a match?
Very funny, very funny.

356
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,455
Put those things
in the car,

357
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,090
and I'll get your tie
and studs ready for you.
Now, hurry up.

358
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,825
Okay, Mom.
Now, don't drop
one of those.

359
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,093
You coming later, George?

360
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,461
What do you mean,
and be bored to death?

361
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,130
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls,

362
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,731
and we're gonna use
that new floor tonight, too.

363
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,266
I hope it works.
No gin tonight, Son.

364

HARRY:
Oh, Pop, just a little?

365
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,969
No, Son. Not one drop.
Oh!

367
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,274
Why do they need gin?

368
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,144
Did I act like that
when I graduated
from high school?

369
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,246
Pretty much.

370
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,814
You know, George, I wish
we could send Harry
to college with you.

371
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,516
Your mother and I
talked it over
half the night.

372
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,453
Mmm. We have that all
figured out.

373

Harry will take my job
at the Building and Loan,

374
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,858
work there for four years,
then he'll go.

375
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,260
Pretty young
for that job.

376
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,062
Well, no younger than I was.

377
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,430
Well, you were
born older, George.

378
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,033
How's that?

379
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,801
I said you were
born older.

380
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,871
I suppose you've decided
what you want to do
when you get out of college.

381
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,706
Oh, well, you know
what I've always
talked about,

382
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,210
build things,
design new buildings,
plan modern cities.

383
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,611
All that stuff
I've been talking about.

384
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,480
Still after
that first million
before you're 30?

385
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,881
I'll settle
for half that in cash.

Of course,
it's just a hope.

388
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,853
But, uh, you wouldn't
consider coming back

389
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,655
to the Building
and Loan, would you?

390
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,094
Well, I... I...

391
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,997
Annie, why--why--why don't
you draw up a chair?

392
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,199
Then you'd be
more comfortable,

393
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,966
and you could hear
everything
that's going on.

394
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,503
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything
worth listening to.

395
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,138
You would, eh?

396
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,107
I know it's soon
to talk about it.

397
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,576
No, now, Pop, I--I couldn't.

398
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,878
I--I couldn't face
being cooped up
for the rest of my life

399
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,714
in a shabby little office.

400
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,719
Oh, I'm sorry, Pop.
I didn't mean that, but I...

401
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,921
I-It's this business
of nickels and dimes

402
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,424
and spending all your life
trying to figure out

403
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,792
how to save three cents
on a length of pipe.
I'd go crazy.

404
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,562
I--I want to do
something big
and something important.

405
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,598
You know, George,
I feel that,
in a small way,

406
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,600
we're doing
something important,

407
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,902
satisfying
a fundamental urge.

408
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:54,274
It's deep in the race
for a man to want his own roof
and walls and fireplace.

409
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:58,044
And we're helping him
get those things
in our shabby little office.

like a miser here

have already
finished college.

I didn't get away, I'd bust.

hear that, Annie?

that George gave up
his trip to Europe

I'd like to get
to my real purpose.

Wait just a minute now.
Wait for what?

I claim this institution
is not necessary
to this town.

670
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,917
Therefore, Mr. Chairman,

671
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,853
I make a motion
to dissolve this institution

672
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:23,789
and turn its assets
and liabilities
over to the receiver.

Mr. Chairman.
It's too soon after

00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,237
Very well.
In that case,

680
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,606
I'll ask the two
executive officers
to withdraw.

681
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,174
But before you go,

682
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,411
I'm sure
the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

683
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,679
at the passing
of Peter Bailey.
Thank you very much.

684
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,381
It was his faith
and devotion

685
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,350
that are responsible
for this organization.

686
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,352
I'll go further
than that.

687
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:57,856
I'll say that
to the public Peter Bailey
was the Building and Loan.

688
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,159
That's fine, Potter,
coming from you,

689
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,228
considering
that you probably
drove him to his grave.

690
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:05,131
Peter Bailey
was not a businessman.

691
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,665
That's what killed him.

692
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,668
Oh, I don't mean
any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.

693
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,372
He was a man
of high ideals, so-called.

694
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:18,044
But ideals
without common sense
can ruin this town.

695
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:21,480
Now, you take this loan here
to Ernie Bishop,

696
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:24,350
you know, that fellow
that sits around all day

697
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,453
on his brains
in his taxi, you know.

698
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:31,123
I happen to know
the bank turned down
this loan.

699
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:32,891
But he comes here,

700
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:38,430
and we're building him
a house worth $5,000.

701
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,933
Why?
Well, I handled
that, Mr. Potter.

702
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,501
You have all
the papers there.

703
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:45,437
His salary, insurance.
I can personally
vouch for his character.

704
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,905
A friend of yours?
Yes, sir.

705
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,007
Uh-huh.

706
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,643
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

707
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,146
you can come
and borrow money.

708
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,148
What does that get us?

709
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:59,118
A discontented, lazy rabble

710
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,087
instead of
a thrifty working class.

711
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,525
And all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers
like Peter Bailey

712
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,260
stir 'em up
and fill their heads

713
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,596
with a lot
of impossible ideas.

714
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,098
Now, I say...

715
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,732
Just a minute.
Just--Just a minute.

716
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,434
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

717
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,770
Now, you're right when you say
my father was no businessman.
I know that.

718
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:22,674
Why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante Building and Loan
I'll never know.

719
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:23,842
But neither you
nor anybody else

720
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,611
can say anything
against his character,

721
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,413
because his whole life was...

722
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,116
Why, in the 25 years since
he and Uncle Billy
started this thing,

723
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,383
he never once
thought of himself.

724
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,718
Isn't that right,
Uncle Billy?

725
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:35,454
He didn't save enough money
to send Harry to school,
let alone me.

726
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:38,290
But he did help a few people
get out of your slums,
Mr. Potter.

727
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:39,758
And what's wrong
with that?

728
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,461
Why, here,
you're all businessmen here.

729
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,862
Don't it make them
better citizens,

730
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,664
and doesn't it make them
better customers?

731
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,733
You--You said that they...
What'd you say
just a minute ago?

732
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,768
They--They had to wait
and save their money

733
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,537
before they even thought
of a decent home.

734
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,305
Wait? Wait for what?

735
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,074
Until their children
grow up and leave them?

736
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,343
Until they're so old
and broken-down that they...

737
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:00,046
Do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $5,000?

738
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,513
Just remember
this, Mr. Potter,

739
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,515
that this rabble
you're talking about,

740
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,284
they do most
of the working and paying

741
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,519
and living and dying
in this community.

742
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:10,056
Well, is it too much
to have them work and pay
and live and die

743
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,923
in a couple of
decent rooms and a bath?

744
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,693
Anyway, my father
didn't think so.

745
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,063
People were human beings
to him, but to you,

746
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:20,132
a warped, frustrated old man,
they're cattle.

747
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,634
Well, in my book, he died
a much richer man
than you'll ever be.

748
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,536
I'm not interested
in your book.

749
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:27,173
I'm talking about
the Building and Loan.

750
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,974
I know very well
what you're talking about.

751
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,211
You're talking about something
you can't get your fingers on,
and it's galling you.

752
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,613
That's what you're
talking about, I know.

753
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,015
Well, I--I--I've said
too much. I...

754
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,884
You're-- You're
the Board here.

755
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,386
You do what you want
with this thing.

756
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:41,687
There's just
one thing more, though.

757
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,756
This town needs
this measly
one-horse institution

758
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,627
if only to have someplace
where people can come
without crawling to Potter.

759
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,828
Come on, Uncle Billy.

760
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:59,238
Sentimental hogwash.
I want my motion.

761
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,073
(ALL CLAMORING)

762
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,709
Boy, oh boy,
that was telling him,
George, old boy.

763
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,611
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

764
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,113
What happened?
We heard
a lot of yelling.

765
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:10,116
Well, we're being
voted out of business
after 25 years.

766
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,717
Easy come, easy go.

767
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,685
TILLY: Here it is.
"Help wanted. Female."

768
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,754
You still want me
to hang around, George?

769
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,089
Yeah, I'll be right down.

770
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:18,357
Yeah, hey,
you'll miss your train.

771
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,259
You're a week late
for school already. Go on.

772
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,527
What's going on
in there?

773
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,129
Oh, never mind.
Don't worry about that.

774
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,563
They're putting us
out of business.

775
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:27,133
So what?
I can get another job.
I'm only 55.

776
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,334
56.

777
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,502
Go on, go on. Hey, look,
you gave up your boat trip,

778
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,171
now you don't want to
miss college, too, do you?

779
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,706
George! George!
They voted Potter down.

780
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,208
They want to
keep it going.

781
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,509
(ALL CHEERING)

782
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,145
You did it, George.
You did it.

783
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,413
They got one condition,
only one condition.

784
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,081
What's that?
And that's
the best part of it.

785
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:46,552
They've appointed George here
as Executive Secretary
to take his father's place.

786
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,786
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...

787
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,488
You can keep him on.
That's all right.

788
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,490
As Secretary,
you can hire anyone you like.

789
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,959
Dr. Campbell, now
let's get this thing
straight. I'm leaving.

790
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,894
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.

791
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,197
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here,
he's your man.

792
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,066
But, George, they'll vote
with Potter otherwise.

793
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,337
CLARENCE: I know, I know,
he didn't go.

794
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,772
JOSEPH: That's right.

795
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,641
Not only that, but he
gave his school money
to his brother, Harry,

796
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:11,210
and sent him
to college.

797
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,179
Harry became
a football star.

798
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,381
Made second team
all-American.

799
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,249
Yeah, but what
happened to George?

800
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,419
JOSEPH: George got
four years older, waiting
for Harry to come back

801
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,488
and take over
the Building and Loans.

802
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,822

plenty of jobs around

likes to travel.

Nobody ever changes here,

to see you.

Oh, wait!
Wait, wait a minute.

I want you to meet Ruth.

Hello.
How do you do?

if you don't mind.

00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,772
Huh?
Well, I wired you
I had a surprise.

828
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,907
Here she is.
Meet the wife.

829
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,777
Well, what do
you know? A wife.

830
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,079
Well, how do you do?

831
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,781
Congratulations.
How do you do?

832
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,650
What am I doing?
Congratulations!

tell somebody?

Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait
to see everybody's reaction.

You're really married?
Why, yes.

marrying this
two-headed brother of mine?

839
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,797
Well, I'll tell you.
It's purely mercenary.

840
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,165
My father
offered him a job.

841
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,567
Oh, he got you
and the job?

00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,570
Well, Harry's cup

like this ever start?

the bank called our loan.

00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:33,811
When?
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.

All of it?

1187
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,547
Every cent of it,
and still it was less
than we owe them.

that you've
closed your doors.

I'm very glad to hear that.

sufficient funds
to meet their needs.

Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

he wants to keep you

of rent he decides.

if Ernie's still here
with his taxicab.

George, there's
a call for you.

1345
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,148
Look, will you get my wife
on the phone?

1346
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,515
She's probably
over at her mother's.

1347
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,151
Mrs. Bailey is
on the phone.

1348

I don't want Mrs. Bailey.
I want my wife.

Oh, that's my wife.

in here.

just as well as I do

that I run
practically everything
in this town

1482

You know, also,
that for a number of years

I've been trying
to get control of it.

But I haven't
been able to do it.

You have been stopping me.

1486
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:35,312
In fact,
you have beaten me, George,

1487
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:39,816
and as anyone in this county
can tell you,
that takes some doing.

Take during the Depression,
for instance.

1489
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,856
You and I were the only ones
that kept our heads.

1490
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,892
You saved
the Building and Loan.

1491
01:08:48,925 --> 01:08:50,894
I saved all the rest.

1492
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:53,630
Yes. Well, most people say
you stole all the rest.

1493
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:57,901
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.

1494
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:02,339
Now, I have stated
my side very frankly.

1495
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:04,508
Now let's look at your side.

1496
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:09,413
Young man, 27-28,

1497
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:12,449
married,
making, say, $40 a week.

1498
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,451
$45.
$45.

1499
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:15,952
$45.

1500
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,322
Out of which,
after supporting
your mother

1501
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:19,923
and paying your bills,

1502
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:23,126
you're able to keep,
say, $10, if you skimp.

1503
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:27,531
A child or two comes along,
and you won't even be able
to save the $10.

1504
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:33,136
Now, if this young man of 28
was a common, ordinary yokel,

1505
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,804
I'd say he was doing fine.

1506
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:39,175
But George Bailey
is not a common,
ordinary yokel.

1507
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:42,946
He is an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man,

1508
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:46,250
who hates his job,
who hates
the Building and Loan

1509
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:48,618
almost as much as I do.

1510
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:53,623
A young man who's been dying
to get out on his own
ever since he was born.

1511
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:56,526
A young man...
The smartest one
of the crowd, mind you.

1512
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,228
A young man
who has to sit by

1513
01:09:58,262 --> 01:10:01,765
and watch
his friends go places
because he's trapped.

1514
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:05,502
Yes, sir, trapped
into frittering his life away,

1515
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:08,137
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters.

1516
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:12,909
Do I paint a correct picture,
or do I exaggerate?

1517
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:16,780
Now, what's
your point, Mr. Potter?

1518
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:17,981
My point?

1519
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:20,650
My point is I want
to hire you.
Hire me?

1520
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:24,153
Yeah, I want you
to manage my affairs,
run my properties.

1521
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:29,293
George, I'll start you out
at $20,000 a year.

1522
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:36,132
$20,000 a year?

1523
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,603
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1524
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:42,372
buying your wife
a lot of fine clothes,

1525
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:45,241
a couple of business trips
to New York a year,

1526
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:47,176
maybe once in a while Europe.

1527
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,578
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, George?

1528
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:49,979
Would I?

1529
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,352
Y-You're not
talking to somebody else
around here, are you?

1530
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,921
You know, this--this is me.
You remember me?
George Bailey.

1531
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,022
George Bailey.

1532
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:03,393
Yeah, George Bailey,
whose ship has just come in.

1533
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:06,663
Provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard.

1534
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,406
Holy mackerel.

1535
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:22,078
Well, how about
the Building and Loan?

1536
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,615
Oh, confound it, man,
are you afraid of success?

1537
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:28,151
I'm offering you
a three-years contract

1538
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:30,620
at $20,000 a year,
starting today.

1539
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:32,389
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1540
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,859
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1541
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:39,696
I--I know I ought to
jump at the chance
but I... I just, uh...

1542
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,367
I--I wonder if it would
be possible for you

1543
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,901
to give me 24 hours
to think it over?

1544
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,670
Sure, sure, sure.

1545
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:49,305
You go on home
and talk about it
to your wife.

1546
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:50,940
I'd like to do that.
Yeah.

1547
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,377
In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.

1548
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,311
All right, sir.
Okay, George?

1549
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:58,648
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1550
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:11,661
No. No. No, no,
now wait a minute, here.
Wait a...

1551
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:13,162
I don't need 24 hours.

1552
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:14,598
I--I don't have
to talk to anybody.

1553
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:18,435
I know right now,
and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!

1554
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:20,970
You sit around here,
and you spin
your little webs,

1555
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,540
and you think the whole world
revolves around you
and your money.

1556
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,174
Well, it doesn't,
Mr. Potter.

1557
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:28,445
In the-- In the whole vast
configuration of things,

1558
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:31,314
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1559
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,348
You...

1560
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,952
And that goes
for you, too!

1561
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:42,125
And it goes for you, too!

1562
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,536
POTTER:
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1563
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,371
buying your wife
a lot of fine clothes,

1564
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:58,975
going to New York
on a business trip
a couple of times a year,

1565
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:02,178
maybe Europe
once in a while.

1566
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,380
GEORGE: I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

1567
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:07,684
and the next
day and next year
and the year after that.

1568
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,920
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy
little town off my feet,

1569
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:12,822
and I'm gonna
see the world.

1570
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:14,090
And then I'm
gonna build things.

1571
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,659
I'm gonna build airfields.

1572
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:18,327
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

1573
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,764
I'm gonna build
a bridge a mile long.

1574
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:23,633
What is it you want, Mary?

1575
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,735
What, you--you want the moon?

1576
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:28,271
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1577
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:30,206
and pull her down for you.

1578
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,676
MARY: * Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?

1579
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:34,110
* Won't you come out
tonight? *

1580
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,779
* Won't you come out
tonight?

1581
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:38,815
* Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight

1582
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,550
* And

1583
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:48,925
Hi.
Hi.

1584
01:13:54,397 --> 01:13:55,699
Mary Hatch,

1585
01:13:58,201 --> 01:14:01,004
why in the world
did you ever marry
a guy like me?

1586
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,074
To keep from
being an old maid.

1587
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:06,610
You could have married
Sam Wainwright

1588
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,712
and anybody else
in town.

1589
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:11,447
I didn't want to marry
anybody else in town.

1590
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:14,618
I want my baby
to look like you.

1591
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:16,720
You didn't even
have a honeymoon.

1592
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:18,121
I promised you...

1593
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,423
Your what?

1594
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,558
My baby.

1595
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:25,529
(STAMMERING) Your...

1596
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,397
Mary, you--you
on the nest?

1597
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:31,100
George Bailey
lassoes stork.

1598
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,669
Lassoes a stork!

1599
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:36,272
Well, you...

1600
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,274
You mean you...

1601
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,409
What is it,
a boy or a girl?

1602
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:41,444
Mmm-hmm.

1603
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,115
JOSEPH: Now, you've
probably already guessed

1604
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:48,384
that George never
leaves Bedford Falls.

1605
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,753
CLARENCE: No!

1606
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:52,822
Mary had her baby,
a boy.

1607
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:55,224
Then she had
another one, a girl.

1608
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:57,293
Day after day
she worked away,

1609
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,429
remaking the old
Granville house
into a home.

1610
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:04,033
Night after night,
George came back
late from the office.

1611
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:10,006
Potter was bearing
down hard.

1612
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,614
Then came a war.

1613
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:21,651
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross
and sewed.

1614
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:25,989
Mary had two more babies
but still found time
to run the USO.

1615
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:29,826
Sam Wainwright made
a fortune in plastic
hoods for planes.

1616
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,295
Potter became head
of the draft board.

1617
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:34,063
One-A.

1618
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:36,465
One-A.

1619
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:40,737
One-A.

1620
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:43,607
Gower and Uncle Billy
sold war bonds.

1621
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:48,211
Bert the cop was wounded
in North Africa,
got the Silver Star.

1622
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:51,881
Ernie the taxi driver
parachuted into France.

1623
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:55,051
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1624
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:56,586
Harry...

1625
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,255
Harry Bailey
topped them all.

1626
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:02,992
A Navy flier,
he shot down 15 planes,

1627
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:04,994
two of them as they were
about to crash

1628
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:07,597
into a transport
full of soldiers.

1629
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:10,433
Yes, but George.

1630
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:11,668
George?

1631
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:13,603
Four-F on account
of his ear,

1632
01:16:13,637 --> 01:16:16,606
George fought the
battle of Bedford Falls.

1633
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,008
Now, hold on!
Hold on! Hold on now!

1634
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:20,443
Don't you know
there's a war on?

1635
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:21,745
Air raid warden.

1636
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:23,246
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

1637
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:32,789
Paper drives.

1638
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,323
Scrap drives.

1639
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:35,792
Rubber drives.

1640
01:16:35,825 --> 01:16:41,330
Like everybody else
on VE Day,
he wept and prayed.

1641
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:46,102
On VJ Day,
he wept and prayed again.

1642
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:48,604
FRANKLIN: Joseph,
now show him
what happened today.

1643
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:49,906
Yes, sir.

1644
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:53,142
This morning,
day before Christmas,
about 10:00 a.m.

1645
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:54,778
Bedford Falls time...

1646
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:56,980
Oh, hey, Ernie.
Look at that.

1647
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,787
It's gonna snow again.

1648
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,388
What do you mean,
it's gonna snow?

1649
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,056
Look at the headlines.
The President...

1650
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,591
I know,
I know, George.

1651
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,759
That's marvelous.

1652
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,194
Commander Harry Bailey!

1653
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:13,797
Mr. Gower, look at this,
the second page.

1654
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,131
Now, look,
this is for you.

1655
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:16,666
This is for you.
That's for you.
Okay.

1656
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,302
ERNIE: Right, right, thanks.
See you again.

1657
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:22,271

spell the name right.

EUSTACE: George, George!
It's Harry now

1662
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:37,553
on long-distance
from Washington.

1663
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:38,988
Harry!
What do you know
about that!

1664
01:17:39,022 --> 01:17:40,757
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?

1665
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,126
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is
for a hero.

1666
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,627
Harry!

1667
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,898
Ha! You old seven times
a son of a gun.
Congratulations.

1668
01:17:48,932 --> 01:17:51,735
Well, h-how's Mother
standing it? She did?

1669
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,102
Well, what do you know?
Huh?

1670
01:17:53,136 --> 01:17:54,804
Mother had lunch with
the President's wife.

1671
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:56,005
Wait till Martha
hears about this.

1672
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:57,807
What did they
have to eat?
What'd they have to eat?

1673
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:59,308
Uh, Harry,

1674
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:02,511
you should see
what they're cooking up
in the town for you.

1675
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:03,679
Oh, they are?

1676
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:05,648
The Navy's gonna
fly Mother home
this afternoon.

1677
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,816
In a plane?

1678
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,185
What? Uncle Billy?

1679
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,453
Has Uncle Billy
come in yet?

1680
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:11,620
Oh, he stopped
at the bank first.

1681
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:13,256
He's not here
right now, Harry.

1682
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,725
But look, now, tell--
tell me about it.
George. George, George.

1683
01:18:15,759 --> 01:18:17,093
What?
That man is here again.

1684
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:18,895
What man?
(STAMMERING)
Bank examiner.

1685
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:20,196
Oh, oh.

1686
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,598
Uh, Harry, talk to Eustace
for a minute, will you?

1687
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:23,867
I'll be right back.

1688
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,334
Well, Harry.

1689
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:26,635
(CLEARING THROAT)
Oh, good morning, sir.

1690
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:28,004

1691
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,239
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1692
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:32,075
We're all excited
around here.

1693
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:34,077
My brother just got
the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

1694
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,311
The President
just decorated him.

1695
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:37,080
Well, I guess they do
those things.

1696
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:38,882
Well, I trust you had
a good year.

1697
01:18:38,915 --> 01:18:40,216
Good year?

1698
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:43,586
Uh, well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1699
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:45,288
Yeah, very funny.

1701
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,159
Well, uh, well, now,
come right in here,
Mr. Carter.

1702
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:52,495
Although I shouldn't
wonder when you okay
reverse charges

1703
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:54,330
on personal
long-distance calls.

1704
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:55,932
George, shall
we hang up?

1705
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,834
No, no. He wants to
talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.

1706
01:18:57,867 --> 01:19:00,603
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish
with you by tonight.

1707
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:03,539
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1708
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,008
I don't blame you at all,
Mr. Carter.

1709
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,275
Just step right in here.
We'll fix you up.

Mr. Potter.
Merry Christmas.

1713
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:25,761
Well, good morning,
Mr. Potter.
What's the news?

1714
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:29,598
Oh, well, well, well,
"Harry Bailey wins
Congressional Medal."

1715
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:31,767
That couldn't be
one of the Bailey boys.

1716
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:35,438
You just can't keep
those Baileys down,
now can you, Mr. Potter?

1717
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:37,941
How does slacker George
feel about that?

1718
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:39,275
Very jealous.
Very jealous.

1719
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:41,577
He only lost three
buttons off his vest.

1720
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,712
Of course,
slacker George
would've gotten

1721
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,748
two of these medals
if he had gone.

1722
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,183
Bad ear.
Yes.

1723
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:51,054
After all, Potter,
some people like George
had to stay at home.

1724
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:54,891
Not every heel
was in Germany
and Japan.

1726
01:20:02,365 --> 01:20:04,333
Good morning,
Mr. Bailey.

1727
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:05,935
Good morning, Horace.

1728
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:08,571
I guess you forgot
something.

1729
01:20:08,604 --> 01:20:09,939
Huh?

1730
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:11,875
You forgot something.
What?

1731
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:13,376
Well, aren't you going
to make a deposit?

1732
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:14,944
Oh, sure, sure I am.

1733
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:17,213
Well, then, it's usually
customary to bring
the money with you.

1734
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:18,581
Huh?

1735
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:20,583
Oh, shucks,

1736
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,652
I knew I had. I...

1737
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,622
How about that
finger there?

1738
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,756
Well, I...

1739
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:29,825
Bailey.

1740
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,734
Take me back there.
Hurry up.

1741
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,072
Come on, look sharp.

1742
01:21:00,756 --> 01:21:02,291
Take me back.

1743
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,802
Just make yourself
at home, Mr. Carter.

1744
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:15,571
I got those books
for you here.

1745
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,006
Oh, hello, Vi.

1746
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,674
George,
can I see you
for a second?

1747
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,877
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.

1748
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:23,980
Oh, Uncle Billy,
talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

Here he is.
Hurry up.

Hello? Hello. Yes, Harry,
yes, everything's fine.

1755
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:39,562
I ought to have
my head examined.

1756
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:42,498
$8,000.
It's got to be
somewhere.

1757

Here you are.

1758
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:52,175
Character?

1759
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:53,542
If I had
any character, I'd...

1760
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,411
It takes a lot of character
to leave your hometown

1761
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:57,080
and start all over again.

1762
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:58,614
No, George, don't.

1763
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:00,716
Here now, you're broke,
aren't you?

1764

I know, but...
What do you want to do,

and that hat?

1766

You want to walk
to New York?

1767
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:09,025
You know, they charge
for meals and rent up there,

1768
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:10,526
just the same as they do
in Bedford Falls.

1769
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:12,628
Yeah, sure.
No, that's a loan, now.

Besides, you'll get a job.

Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1792
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:25,334
He had it on his desk
counting it
before he closed up.

1793

did you buy anything?

do you realize
what's going to happen
if we don't find it?

Listen to me.

1806
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:59,435
Do you have any

01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:32,495
Way up at the top.
There. That's it.

1841
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:36,031
All right,
fill in that little bare spot
right there. Right there.

1842
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:37,200
(GRUNTING)

1843
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:40,636
MARY: Isn't it
wonderful about Harry?

1844
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:42,104
We're famous, George.

1845
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:46,008
Bet I had 50 calls today
about the parade,
the banquet.

1846
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,143
Your mother's so excited.
She...

1847
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:52,315
(JANIE CONTINUES
PLAYING PIANO)

1848
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:11,300
Must she keep
playing that?

1849
01:26:11,334 --> 01:26:14,203
I have to practice it
for the party tonight,
Daddy.

1850
01:26:14,237 --> 01:26:17,440
Mama said we could
stay up till midnight
and sing Christmas carols.

1851
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:19,342
Can you sing, Daddy?

1852
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:20,943
MARY: Better hurry
and shave.

1853
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:22,645
The families
will be here soon.

1854
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:23,979
Families.

1855
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:26,215
I--I don't want
the families over here.

1856
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:31,354
Come on out
in the kitchen with me
while I finish dinner.

1857
01:26:31,387 --> 01:26:34,790
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1858
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:36,792
Have a hectic day?
Oh, yeah.

1859
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:40,162
Another
big red-letter day
for the Baileys.

1860
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,031
Daddy, the Browns next door
have a new car.
You should see it.

1861
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:44,267
Well, what's the
matter with our car?

1862
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,601
Isn't it good enough
for you?

1863
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:46,802
Yes, Daddy.

1864
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:49,272
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1865
01:26:49,305 --> 01:26:50,639
Excuse you for what?

1866
01:26:50,673 --> 01:26:52,708
I burped.

1867
01:26:52,741 --> 01:26:54,277
(SIGHING)
All right, darling,
you're excused.

1868
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:57,480
Now, go on upstairs
and see if little Zuzu
wants anything.

1869
01:26:57,513 --> 01:26:59,615
Zuzu? W-W-What's
the matter with Zuzu?

1870
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:01,784
Oh, she's just got a cold.
She's in bed.

1871
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:03,319
Caught it coming
home from school.

1872
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:05,954
They gave her a flower
for a prize, and she didn't
want to crush it,

1873
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:07,256
so she didn't
button up her coat.

1874
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,258
What is it,
a sore throat or what?
It's just a cold.

1875
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:10,826
The doctor says
it's nothing serious.
The doctor?

1876
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:12,361
Was the doctor here?

1877
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:13,996
Yes, I called him right away.
He says it's nothing
to worry about.

1878
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:15,364
Is she running
a temperature?
What is it?

1879
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:17,600
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.

1880
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:19,167
Of course,
it's this old house.

1881
01:27:19,201 --> 01:27:21,470
I don't know why
we don't all
have pneumonia.

1882
01:27:21,504 --> 01:27:22,938
Drafty old barn.

1883
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:26,008
Might as well be living
in a refrigerator.

1884
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,843
Why did we have
to live here
in the first place

1885
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:30,746
and stay around this
measly, crummy old town?

1886
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:33,115
George, what's wrong?

1887
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:35,651
Wrong! Everything's wrong.
You call this
a happy family?

1888
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:37,786
Why do we have to have
all these kids?

1889
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,522
PETE: Dad, how do you
spell "frankincense"?

1890
01:27:39,555 --> 01:27:41,557
I don't know.
Ask your mother.

1891
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,392
Where're you going?
I'm going up to see Zuzu.

1892
01:27:43,426 --> 01:27:45,294
He told me to write
a play for tomorrow.

1893
01:27:46,128 --> 01:27:47,930
(PIANO PLAYING CONTINUES)

1894
01:27:56,772 --> 01:28:00,676
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1895
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:02,077
Hi, Daddy!

1896
01:28:03,178 --> 01:28:04,947
Well, what happened
to you?

1897
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,749
I won a flower.

1898
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:08,584
Wait now.
Where do you think
you're going?

1899
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,285
I want to give
my flower a drink.

1900
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:12,821
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.

1901
01:28:12,855 --> 01:28:13,989
I'll give it a drink.

1902
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,358
Now, here.

1903
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:19,027
Look, Daddy!

1904
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:20,529
Paste it!

1905
01:28:20,563 --> 01:28:23,098
Yeah, all right, all right.
Give it here.

1906
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:28,103
Now, we'll paste
this together here.

1907
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,643
There. There it is.
Good as new.

1908
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:36,845
Now, give the flower
a drink.

1909
01:28:36,879 --> 01:28:38,347
Now, will you do
something for me?

1910
01:28:38,381 --> 01:28:39,682
(WHISPERING) What?

1911
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:41,249
(WHISPERING) Will you try
and get some sleep?

1912
01:28:41,283 --> 01:28:42,718
I'm not sleepy.

1913
01:28:42,751 --> 01:28:44,186
I want to look
at my flower.

1914
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,555
I know, I know,
but you just go to sleep

1915
01:28:46,589 --> 01:28:48,924
and then you can
dream about it,

1916
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:51,159
and it'll be
a whole garden.

1917
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:52,428
It will?

1918
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:53,462
Uh-huh.

1919
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,003
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1920
01:29:01,036 --> 01:29:02,705
KIDS: Telephone!

1921
01:29:02,738 --> 01:29:04,172
I'll get it.

1922
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:07,576
Hello?

1923
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:10,546
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1924
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:12,415
MARY: Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Welch.

1925
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,749
I'm sure
she'll be all right.

1926
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:15,217
The doctor said
that she ought to be
out of bed

1927
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,519
in time to have
her Christmas dinner.

1928
01:29:16,552 --> 01:29:18,153
Is that Zuzu's teacher?
Yes.

1929
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,588
Let me speak to her.

1930
01:29:19,622 --> 01:29:22,458
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1931
01:29:22,491 --> 01:29:24,960
This is George Bailey.
I'm Zuzu's father.

1932
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:26,762
Say, what kind of
a teacher are you,
anyway?

1933
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:29,097
What do you mean
sending her home
like that, half naked?

1934
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:30,265
Do you realize
she'll probably
end up

1935
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:31,634
with pneumonia
on account of you?

1936
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:33,869
George!
Is this the sort of thing
we pay taxes for

1937
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:36,004
to have teachers...
to have teachers like you?

1938
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,706
Stupid, silly,
careless people

1939
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,374
who send our kids home
without any clothes on?

1940
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:41,276
You know,
maybe my kids aren't
the best-dressed kids.

1941
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:43,078
And maybe they don't have
any decent clothes...

1942
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:45,614
That stupid...

1943
01:29:45,648 --> 01:29:48,584
H-H-Hello, Mrs. Welch.
I want to apologize...

1944
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,753
Hello? Hello.

1945
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:54,990
She's hung up!
I'll hang her up!

1946
01:29:55,023 --> 01:29:58,260
MAN ON PHONE: Hey, you!
I'll knock your block off!
What is that?

1947
01:29:58,293 --> 01:30:00,162
Hello! Who's this?

1948
01:30:00,195 --> 01:30:02,064
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1949
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:03,566
Okay, that's fine,
Mr. Welch.

1950
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:05,868
Give me a chance
to tell you what I really
think of your wife.

1951
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,704
George, stop it.
Will you get out
and let me handle this?

1952
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:11,273
Hello? Hello? What?

1953
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,710
Oh, you will, huh?

1954
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:17,746
Okay, Mr. Welch.
Any time you think
you're man enough, you...

1955
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,314
Hello! Any...

1956
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,653
Dad, how do you spell
"hallelujah"?

1957
01:30:24,687 --> 01:30:26,489
How should I know?
What do you think I am,
a dictionary?

1958
01:30:26,522 --> 01:30:27,890
Tommy, stop that!
Stop it!

1959
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:29,792
Janie,
haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

1960
01:30:29,825 --> 01:30:32,828
You play it over
and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!

1961
01:31:00,623 --> 01:31:02,257
I'm sorry, Mary.

1962
01:31:05,528 --> 01:31:07,162
Janie, I'm sorry.

1963
01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:09,932
I didn't mean that. I...

1964
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:12,668
You go on and practice.

1965
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:20,175
Pete, I owe you
an apology, too.

1966
01:31:21,443 --> 01:31:22,811
I'm sorry.

1967
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,781
What do you want to know?

1968
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,182
Nothing, Daddy.

1969
01:31:34,122 --> 01:31:35,958
What's the matter
with everybody?

1970
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:38,661
Janie, go on.
I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!

1971
01:31:38,694 --> 01:31:40,028
Oh, Daddy!

George, why must you
torture the children?
Why don't you...

01:31:49,471 --> 01:31:50,706

(DOOR CLOSING)

1976

Bedford 247, please.

1977
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:08,891
Is Daddy in trouble?
Yes, Pete.

1978
01:32:08,924 --> 01:32:10,492
Shall I pray for him?

1979
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,194
Yes, Janie,
pray very hard.

1980
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:14,096
Me, too?
You, too, Tommy.

1981
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:17,566
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1982
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,601
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1983
01:32:20,068 --> 01:32:21,336
I need help.

1984
01:32:22,337 --> 01:32:23,772
Through some
sort of an accident,

1985
01:32:23,806 --> 01:32:25,373
my company's short
in their accounts.

1986
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:27,442
The bank examiner
got there today.

1987
01:32:27,475 --> 01:32:29,645
I've got to raise
$8,000 immediately.

1988
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:32,180
Oh, that's what
the reporters wanted
to talk to you about?

1989
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:33,548
The reporters?
Yes.

1990
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:37,319
They called me up
from your Building and Loan.

1991
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:40,689
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1992
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:42,124
He's looking for you.

1993
01:32:42,157 --> 01:32:43,859
Please help me,
Mr. Potter.

1994
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,828
Help me,
won't you, please?

1995
01:32:45,861 --> 01:32:47,763
Can't you see
what it means
to my family?

1996
01:32:47,796 --> 01:32:50,599
I'll pay any sort of
a bonus on the loan,
any interest,

1997
01:32:50,633 --> 01:32:52,200
if you still want
the Building and Loan...

1998
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,269
George,
could it possibly be

1999
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:55,971
there's
a slight discrepancy
in the books?

2000
01:32:56,004 --> 01:32:57,439
No, sir. There's nothing
wrong with the books.

2001
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,609
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.

2002
01:33:00,643 --> 01:33:02,510
You misplaced $8,000?

2003
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,080
Yes, sir.

2004
01:33:07,783 --> 01:33:09,551
Have you notified
the police?

come to me?

01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:29,811
I haven't won my wings yet.

2175
01:42:29,844 --> 01:42:31,813
That's why I'm
an Angel Second Class.

2176
01:42:36,884 --> 01:42:38,353
I don't know whether
I'd like it very much

2177
01:42:38,386 --> 01:42:40,388
being seen around
with an angel
without any wings.

2178
01:42:40,422 --> 01:42:42,857
Oh, I've got to earn them,

2179
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:44,158
and you'll help me,
won't you?

2180
01:42:44,192 --> 01:42:45,793
Sure, sure.

2181
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:46,961
How?

2182
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:48,930
By letting me help you.

2183
01:42:48,963 --> 01:42:51,699
Yes. Only one way
you can help me.

2184
01:42:51,733 --> 01:42:53,935
You--you don't happen
to have 8,000 bucks
on you, do you?

2185
01:42:53,968 --> 01:42:56,371
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money
in heaven.

2186
01:42:56,404 --> 01:42:59,641
Oh, yeah, that's right,
I keep forgetting.

2187
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,576
Comes in pretty handy
down here, bub.

2188
01:43:01,609 --> 01:43:03,211
Oh, tut, tut, tut.

2189
01:43:04,346 --> 01:43:06,080
I found it out
a little late.

2190
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,983
I'm worth more
dead than alive.

2191
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,852
Now, look, you mustn't
talk like that.

2192
01:43:10,885 --> 01:43:13,321
I won't get my wings
with that attitude.

2193
01:43:13,355 --> 01:43:15,790
You just don't know
all that you've done.

2194
01:43:15,823 --> 01:43:17,124
If it hadn't been
for you...

2195
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:18,426
Yeah, if it hadn't
been for me,

2196
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,861
everybody'd be
a lot better off.

2197
01:43:19,894 --> 01:43:22,096
My wife and my kids
and my friends.

2198
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:23,398
I mean, look,
little fellow,

2199
01:43:23,431 --> 01:43:25,467
go off and haunt
somebody else, will you?

2200
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,235
No, now,
you don't understand.

2201
01:43:27,269 --> 01:43:29,437
I've got my job...
Oh, shut up, will you?

2202
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,744
Oh, this isn't gonna
be so easy.

2203
01:43:41,516 --> 01:43:44,151
Yeah, so you still think
killing yourself

2204
01:43:44,185 --> 01:43:46,354
would make everyone
feel happier, eh?

2205
01:43:47,922 --> 01:43:50,091
Well, I don't know.
I guess you're right.

2206
01:43:51,926 --> 01:43:53,094
I suppose it would
have been better

2207
01:43:53,127 --> 01:43:54,696
if I'd never been
born at all.

2208
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:56,097
What'd you say?

2209
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:58,466
I said I wish
I'd never been born.

2210
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,436
Oh, you mustn't say
things like that.

2211
01:44:01,469 --> 01:44:04,706
You...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2212
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,240
That's an idea.

2213
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:08,476
What do you think?

2214
01:44:09,344 --> 01:44:10,778
Yeah, that'll do it.

2215
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,080
All right.

2216
01:44:15,817 --> 01:44:17,719
You've got your wish.

2217
01:44:17,752 --> 01:44:19,554
You've never been born.

to make all that fuss
about it!

01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:30,064
What did you say?

2221
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,266
You've never been born.
You don't exist.

2222
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:33,901
You haven't a care
in the world.

2223
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:37,372
No worries, no obligations,
no $8,000 to get,

no Potter looking for you
with the Sheriff.

2225
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,475
Say something else
in that ear.

2226
01:44:40,508 --> 01:44:42,744
Sure, you can hear
out of it.

2227
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:44,979
Well, that's
the doggonedest thing.

2228
01:44:45,012 --> 01:44:47,615
I haven't heard anything
out of that ear
since I was a kid.

2229
01:44:47,649 --> 01:44:49,851
Must have been that jump
in that cold water.

too, George.

about that?

01:45:02,564 --> 01:45:04,832
It stopped snowing
out here, didn't it?

01:45:04,866 --> 01:45:07,435
Well, I...
What's happened here?

2235
01:45:07,469 --> 01:45:09,337
What I need is a couple
of good stiff drinks.

2236
01:45:09,371 --> 01:45:11,205
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?

about that?

than I thought.

Now, come on,
get your clothes on.

to my car and get...

I'll stroll. You fly.

my wings.

Well, this is where
I left my car,
and it isn't here.

You have no car.

2251

Well, I had a car,
and it was right here.

I guess somebody
moved it.
Good evening.

w-where's my car?

What do you mean,
what tree?

2257
01:45:57,519 --> 01:45:59,721
This tree.
Here, I ran into it.

2258
01:45:59,754 --> 01:46:02,990
Cut a big gash
in the side of it there.

two other trees.

Pottersville?

01:46:14,402 --> 01:46:15,970
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

2264
01:46:16,003 --> 01:46:17,805
I mean Pottersville.

I know where I live?

with you?

or he is or you are.

up at Martini's.

enough for that,

01:48:00,274 --> 01:48:03,310
just give him
the same as mine.

act like that before.

No wonder you jumped
in the river.

to save you
so I could get my wings.

a bell ring, it means

2320

you better not mention

2323

around here.

in angels?

in them.

they be surprised
when they see one?

grew up. He's...

anyway, Clarence?

or out the window.

01:58:35,342 --> 01:58:37,110
But where are
the houses?

2503
01:58:37,144 --> 01:58:38,945
You weren't here
to build them.

2504
01:58:43,684 --> 01:58:46,720
Your brother Harry Bailey
broke through the ice

2505
01:58:46,753 --> 01:58:48,689
and was drowned
at the age of nine.

2506
01:58:48,722 --> 01:58:50,857
That's a lie.
Harry Bailey
went to war.

2507

He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

He saved
the lives of every man
on that transport.

Every man
on that transport died.

2510
01:58:56,730 --> 01:58:57,964
Harry wasn't there
to save them,

2511
01:58:57,998 --> 01:59:00,267
because you weren't there
to save Harry.

2513
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:15,882

tell me where my wife is.

Please, Clarence,
tell me where she is.

2522

You're not gonna
like it, George.
Where is she?

2523
01:59:37,037 --> 01:59:39,473
She's an old maid.
She never married.

Oh, Mr. Gower!

2674
02:06:27,447 --> 02:06:29,950

I changed my mind.

I've been saving
this money

2678
02:06:38,324 --> 02:06:40,326
if ever I get a husband.

2679

There you are, George.
I got the faculty
all up and out of bed.

2681
02:06:48,434 --> 02:06:50,270
Here's something

I wouldn't have
a roof over my head

2683
02:06:53,874 --> 02:06:55,441

for you, George.

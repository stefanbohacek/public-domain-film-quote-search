Sergeant Williams,
take care of the patrol.

24
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:52,383
The Orduna is coming in.

25
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,461
If we don't get Horn to
the dock for cigarettes ..

26
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,126
These boys will tear down his store.

27
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,924
Hello, mama. How's it by you today?

28
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,134
Hello. You alright?

29
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:19,907
Kinda cheery this morning, ain't we?

30
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,927
All together now.
- Heave ho.

31
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,887
Now tell us, mama, where is the old man?

32
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,636
What do you want, huh?
- Cigarettes.

33
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,285
Cigarettes, no got here.

34
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,982
That's just it.
- Where is Horn?

35
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,187
Asleep, huh?

36
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,405
Well we'll have that bird on his feet
and down to the docks chop-chop pronto.

37
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,711
I think so, no.
- I think so, yes.

38
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,167
Go get him, boys.

39
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:49,511
What's the matter, mama?
The old man acting up again.

40
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,773
How you know?

41
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,975
What he say?

42
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,303
My husband is a very good man.

43
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,632
What's all this?

44
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,907
What's all this?
- Relax.

45
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,155
Where am I?

46
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,325
Home.

47
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:03,997
To be sure.

48
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,115
The Orduna is in, Joe.
- Well, what of it?

49
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,582
No corn, no sardines, no corned beef.

50
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:10,818
And no cigarettes.

51
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,422
On your feet, mate.

52
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:14,331
Fall in.

53
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:16,433
Wait, wait.

54
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:19,491
Much too early in the morning for me.

55
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,835
Wipe your chin.

56
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:24,631
Oh well, it's raining less than it was.

57
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,112
Let me see.

58
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,094
You want my passport, don't you.

59
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:43,012
My husband and I usually
use the same passport.

60
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:45,208
We have separate ones this time.

61
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,407
In case I should wish to visit the
other island while he's working.

62
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:51,259
I wonder why it must rain.

63
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:53,925
Doesn't it ever stop?
- Yes, ma'am.

64
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:59,766
A little more efficiency and we
wouldn't be kept waiting so long.

65
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,867
Wait just a minute.

66
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,662
There you are.

67
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,548
Thank you. Just put it down, please.

68
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:30,917
By the way officer, I was wondering:
what does Pago Pago mean?

69
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:33,034
I don't think it means
anything at all, sir.

70
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,602
Then it is certainly well-named.

71
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,248
Unusual weather, of course.

72
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:41,255
Of course.

73
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,038
What will it be like in Apia?

74
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:44,798
The usual.

75
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,933
Welcome to Pago Pago, Mr Davidson.

76
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,024
Thank you, but we're only
here for an hour or so.

77
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,944
We take the schooner
this afternoon for Apia.

78
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,673
Not this afternoon, I'm afraid.
- Oh?

79
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:03,834
Sorry, sir.

80
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,152
Thank you.

81
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:13,964
What's the matter, Alfred?
Has anything happened?

82
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,680
Unwelcome news. We cannot
sail for Apia this afternoon.

83
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,643
Not sail today? Why?

84
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:22,072
One of the sailors aboard the schooner
has come down with cholera.

85
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:25,859
It cannot start until it is certain that
none of the other crew are affected.

86
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,693
It may mean a delay of several days.

87
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:30,758
I think I'd prefer the cholera.

88
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,603
But where can we stay?

89
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:34,169
The general store.

90
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:38,385
There is Mister Horn now. Mister Horn ..

91
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:43,443
Well, upon my soul.

92
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:45,002
This is a treat.

93
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,130
How do you do, Mrs Davidson.
- Greetings, Mr Horn.

94
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:49,692
Our poor island is honored.

95
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:52,131
Doctor and Mrs Macphail - Mr Horn.

96
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,580
How do you do. You're leaving soon?

97
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,073
The schooner for Apia is delayed
on account of the Cholera.

98
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:58,840
We shall have to ask you to put us up.

99
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,326
That's tough luck.

100
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,597
For you folks, I mean.

101
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,989
Can nothing be done?

102
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,081
It may be possible I can persuade the
Governor to make an exception for us.

103
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,604
I'm going to see him now.

104
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:16,573
Hey, Joe.

105
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,699
If my guests will pardon
me for a few minutes.

106
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,693
They shall have my
personal escort to the hotel.

107
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:24,815
What's the matter, Joe?

108
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,477
If there is anything
I hate, it's reformers.

109
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:29,731
Ha .. so that's what's
the matter with them.

110
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:30,691
Yeah.

111
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:34,289
You'd better watch yourself while
that lovely couple is on the island.

112
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,621
They'd break your
back to save your soul.

113
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,131
What's his badge?

114
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,337
Investigator of Native Conditions.

115
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,530
A professional reformer.

116
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,362
He wields more influence
in the South Seas than ..

117
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:48,037
Than the sun, the planets and
the American government.

118
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,603
Ha .. the worst is yet to come.

119
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,661
Pearls of wisdom, boys.

120
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,480
Now look here.

121
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,179
You make take the
British lion by the tail.

122
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:04,353
You may twist it, you may jerk it.

123
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:07,858
You may yank it.
You may tie it in a big bow knot.

124
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,818
But dash it all, you can't
pull it up by the roots.

125
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,576
I say, can't you take a joke?

126
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,453
Hello lads, boys.

127
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:19,035
I want you to meet Thompson.

128
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:20,621
Sadie, meet the boys.

129
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,833
Boys.

130
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,386
And this is Mr Horn.

131
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:27,372
Mr Horn, your climate is bummed.

132
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,611
Sorry, Sadie. It's the best we got.

133
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,008
I'm not blaming you.

134
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:34,284
Say, what's this about a delay? How long
am I booked for this boat, do you know?

135
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:37,397
Well, I've composed myself
for a two-week stay.

136
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:43,058
Well, that being the case, what can't be
helped, can't be helped, as they say.

137
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:46,180
That job in the field will keep alright,
Sadie, so I shouldn't worry about it.

138
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:47,643
I'm never worried, Elmer.

139
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,504
Make the best of things today
because it can't be worse tomorrow.

140
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:54,299
Besides .. I like the boys here.

141
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,008
Hello, Handsome.
When did you leave Kansas?

142
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,297
She got you that time, kid.

143
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:03,491
Shut up, you hyena.

144
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,894
He's very shy, Miss. Don't mind him.

145
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,601
Lay off sailor, or I'll
swab the deck with you.

146
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:12,622
Ah, don't hit him, Handsome.
I came from Kansas once myself.

147
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,615
As fast as I could hoof it.

148
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,722
How are you?

149
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,003
Fine.

150
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:20,879
Very pleased to meet a lady.

151
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:26,993
Better look out, Miss.
He's liable to bite.

152
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,000
Sounds like they had too much oats.

153
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:31,039
Ah she is a one.

154
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,855
Lads, allow me to inform you
that Sadie is a bit of alright.

155
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,933
Say, you'll find some place for
Sadie to sleep won't you, Joe?

156
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,355
With pleasure.

157
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:42,019
And now shall we discuss
our sordid business matters?

158
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,732
Now then, you know how it is
when you're travelling a bit short.

159
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,040
You see, Sadie left
Honolulu a bit sudden like.

160
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,309
She's a good kid although
she's down on her luck a bit.

161
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,604
Now she can't pay over
a dollar a day for her room.

162
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,068
And you've got to take care
of her for that. Will you, Joe?

163
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,015
Yeah, I was telling the Quartermaster
here I'll board myself. I got a Bour ..

164
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,716
Some Bourbon with me and
besides, I don't eat so much.

165
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,687
Oh, that'll be alright.

166
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,172
Mrs Horn will take care of you.

167
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:06,829
Well.

168
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:08,141
Here's bubbles.

169
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:01,331
I hear life is terrible back
home in the States, now.

170
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:02,211
How so?

171
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:04,729
Everybody being made to behave.
- Yes.

172
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,933
We live in the day of
the new commandment:

173
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:09,634
"<i>Thou shalt not enjoy thyself"</i>.

174
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,203
I saw it coming twenty years ago.

175
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:14,621
That's why I left Chicago.

176
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:16,465
I wanted peace.

177
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,075
And I found it, too.

178
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:21,038
Friend.

179
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:25,251
You behold here the last
remnants of an earthly paradise.

180
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,221
That's my quarrel with reformers.

181
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,889
They won't let it alone.

182
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:34,012
Yes, I can readily see how a reformer
might feel a little out of place here.

183
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:37,972
Sort of like a schoolmarm
waking up in a harem.

184
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,997
Do you remember what we were
talking about the other night?

185
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,357
Have you told Dr Macphail yet?

186
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:47,663
You mean about marriage
customs and the moon-dancing?

187
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,248
Yes.

188
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:50,601
What did he say?

189
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,606
Well, he never says very much.

190
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,292
But I'm sure he thought
it was perfectly awful.

191
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,580
Now take these islanders, doctor.

192
00:12:58,008 --> 00:13:00,976
They are naturally the happiest,
most contented people on earth.

193
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:03,195
They ask nothing of life.

194
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:04,949
Except to be allowed to eat ..

195
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,780
And sing .. and dance .. and sleep.

196
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:09,939
Thinking gives them a headache.

197
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:12,702
The trees and the sea gives
them all the food they want ..

198
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,136
So they don't have to fight.

199
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:17,428
They're satisfied with their
Gods of the wind and waves.

200
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,108
And along comes Mr Davidson
who tells them they are lost souls.

201
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,734
They've got to be saved
whether they want to be or not.

202
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,632
Too bad Man couldn't develop a soul
without losing the Garden of Eden.

203
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,380
You're a philosopher, doctor.

204
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,110
No. I just look out.

205
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,485
<i>Did</i>, old brother.

206
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,445
But I guess we both feel the joy.

207
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,689
And now.

208
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,885
Welcome to Villa Horn.

209
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:46,351
He's new here and besides,
his eyesight is bad.

210
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,384
Yeah, I know.

211
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,273
His is bad and yours is good.

212
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:52,327
But mine is better and
I'm taking Handsome.

213
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,587
You boys can pick up those packages
and tag along at the back if you like.

214
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,160
But don't get run over.

215
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,043
That's done it.

216
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:04,347
And the jackass said,
no, not now, it's too hot.

217
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,653
But in the cool of the
evening, I'll be there.

218
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:11,199
Moses on a mountain top.

219
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,332
So this is the sunny South Seas?

220
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:14,656
What a place.

221
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,892
Nothing but quiet and mud.

222
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,594
Farewell, pretty ones.

223
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,964
Farewell.

224
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,874
You ain't looked like that
since our first auto ride.

225
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:26,969
Take that stuff and put it
down anywhere, boys.

226
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:31,337
Well I guess my idea of me looking neat
and chipper when I get to Apia is shot.

227
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,352
Oh, I shouldn't worry about that, Sadie.

228
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,201
With all this heat, you'll soon
be as dry as a blotting pad.

229
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,387
<i>Shikata ga nai, Shikata ga nai</i>.

230
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:41,000
That's "I should worry"
in Jap', buttercup.

231
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:45,777
Mrs Macphail, tomorrow you and
must sew the mosquito netting.

232
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,928
Or the nights will be unendurable.

233
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:51,088
Why not sew them today? I have
no fancy for being eaten up tonight.

234
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:54,384
I prefer not to do any
sewing on the Sabbath.

235
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,010
It would be different if one
were indecently exposed.

236
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,203
By a tear in one's
clothing, for instance.

237
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,824
But under the circumstances it might
be a very bad example for the natives.

238
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,565
I suppose I'll find it pretty slow
down in Apia won't I, Grandpa?

239
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,583
Things ought to brighten up
considerable after you get there.

240
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,994
Oh, mister Horn!

241
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,560
Say lads, I thought you would have been
thirsty enough to locate it by instinct.

242
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,859
Here, I'll look. There's the
shy Kentucky refugee.

243
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:26,742
Who's got a corkscrew?

244
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,737
Here you are, Sadie.

245
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:33,512
Thanks, baldy.

246
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,470
Well boys, let's dip the beak.

247
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,581
Well now, ain't that a beautiful sight.

248
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:42,154
After you, lady.

249
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:45,915
I'll get a glass for you, Miss Thompson.
- What for? Down the hatch.

250
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,330
Now there is a lady after my own heart.

251
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:51,217
A friend of mine slipped me
that before I left Honolulu.

252
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,387
"Not that you need it, Sadie", said he.
- And right he was, Sadie.

253
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,688
You're not the type that
needs hooch to pep you up.

254
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,198
Nah, I was born hooched.

255
00:15:58,403 --> 00:15:59,684
Willy, Willy. Look at this.

256
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,260
"The Wabash Blues".

257
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,014
Music and a nip of liquor.

258
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,229
That's what a rainy day is for, says I.

259
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,463
Can you dance, Handsome?

260
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,695
No, Miss Thompson.

261
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,086
I'm a club foot. I never
could twist my legs right.

262
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,039
Well, I'll learn you before
I leave. That's a threat.

263
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,285
The Quartermaster here is a great little
stepper. You watch him shake a shoe.

264
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,128
For one of his brains and
years .. you'd be surprised.

265
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,057
Come on Ethelbert, let's
show these island boys ..

266
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,791
How to dance the gig in Honolulu.

267
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:28,680
Righto. Let's have a go at it.

268
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,395
Here, park my cabbage.

269
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,474
Now, nothing too fancy now.
- Nope.

270
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:38,345
[ Music: loud ]

271
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:49,547
Slow down.

272
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:56,829
That's the stuff, matey.
Hit the high side.

273
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:02,577
Attaboy.

274
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:03,950
Young woman.

275
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,715
What step you doing now, Bertie?

276
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:08,376
Young woman, have you no
respect for the Lord's day?

277
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:09,182
What?

278
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,868
This is Sunday, young woman.
- Were you speaking to me?

279
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,677
I am simply reminding you
that this is the Sabbath.

280
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,126
The Sabbath? Let me see. Right you are.

281
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,029
I say this must stop.

282
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:20,699
Do you hear me?

283
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:23,707
I say ma'am, are not disturbing you?

284
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,620
Whether I am being disturbed
or not is of no consequence.

285
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:29,673
There are six days in the week
to dance, if you must dance.

286
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:33,532
Mr Horn, is this sort of
thing general in your store?

287
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,243
Well, it's a General Store, ma'am.

288
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:39,032
Oh, enough said.
Complaint is registered.

289
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:43,170
We'll go to my private suite
if you've no objection, Mr Horn.

290
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,655
No objection as far as I'm concerned.

291
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,952
Come on, Ethelbert.

292
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,748
Come on, boys. We're moving.

293
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,080
You bring the records, Handsome.
And you bring the hooch.

294
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:56,300
Drop in later if you feel like it,
Mr Horn. Always glad to see you.

295
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,138
Who is that young woman?

296
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:03,199
Her name ma'am is
"Thompson" as far as I know.

297
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:04,978
I mean, <i>what</i> is she?

298
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:06,709
I didn't enquire.

299
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:08,833
She was on the Orduna, wasn't she?

300
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:10,580
I am aware she was.

301
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:16,617
I am afraid Mr Davidson
will not like this at all.

302
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:24,191
I've argued it out with the Governor
but there is nothing to be done.

303
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,549
That means ten days here.

304
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,284
Two weeks, probably.

305
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,233
Well, I'm prepared for the worst.
I've taken rooms for us upstairs.

306
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,680
Two weeks with nothing to occupy us.

307
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,173
This enforced inactivity is
likely to prove wearisome.

308
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,671
The only thing to do is to apportion
out the day to different occupations.

309
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:44,547
Certain hours of the day
we will set aside for study.

310
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:47,360
And certain hours for .. exercise.

311
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,594
Rain or shine.

312
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:50,739
Then too, certain hours we'll go for ..

313
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:52,584
Recreation.

314
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:55,649
Recreation may be hard to find.
- Someone appears to have found it.

315
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,782
It's a person from the second class.

<i>Exceedingly</i> common.

00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,343
Very flashily dressed.

318
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:04,595
In fact she looks rather .. <i>fast </i>to me.

319
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,237
Perhaps you noticed her on the boat?
- I met her.

320
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,245
Rather a good-natured girl on
her way to a position in Apia.

321
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:14,018
What kind of a girl?
- Oh, just an ordinary human being.

322
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,935
Not over-prosperous, I should say.

323
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,428
I think it is perfectly outrageous for
her to keep that music up, don't you?

324
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:22,577
If she wishes to play her own machine
it is not our right to interfere.

325
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:24,006
By the way, doctor.

326
00:19:24,106 --> 00:19:26,593
You can visit the Naval hospital
tomorrow if it would interest you.

327
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:28,950
It's a busman's holiday, but I'll go.

The Orduna must be going
out before her scheduled time.

330
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,113
I hate to see her go.

331
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,368
She seemed to be our
last link with home.

332
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:44,896
You'd better hurry,
or you're going to get licked.

Righto, Sadie. I'm sorry I can't
stay for lunch but I'm off.

334
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:51,572
But I hopes I'll see you again sometime,
as you're a good kid and I like you.

335
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:55,305
I tell you what you do. You write me a
nice, little loving postcard. Will you?

336
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,621
Righto .. a nice little postcard.

337
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,793
And once you write it,
just drop it in the ocean.

Goodbye, Mr Davidson.

343
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,263
I got stranded on the Mary Jane.

344
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,320
And I guessed I never
will get home again.

345
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,605
Goodbye, Mr Davidson.

Hello, Mr Davidson.

Better get aboard, Quartermaster.
As fast as you can.

349
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,950
Righto. Well, goodbye everybody.

00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,234
Bye-bye folks.

The King's in wrong, but I'm in right.

The King stays out most every night.

And I start six months off.

Goodbye, Mr Davidson.

Come on, the tea is getting cold.

356
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,555
How long has this been going on?
- All morning.

357
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,446
Where did those marines come from?

358
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,738
They just appeared from
nowhere, in her wake.

359
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,424
If we're to have a fortnight
of this sort of thing ..

360
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:28,060
I don't know what we shall
all feel like at the end of it.

361
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,567
What's the matter, Alfred?

362
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,655
Of course. It just occurred to me.
The woman is out of Ibolé.

363
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,431
The thought came to me when I first
saw her but I didn't dare speak of it.

364
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:38,841
What is Ibolé?

365
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:41,747
The .. plague spot of Honolulu.

366
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:44,806
That long-haired guy in there
just gave me the filthiest look.

367
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:47,508
What are you going to do, Alfred?

368
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,332
What do you expect me to do? I won't
have this house turned into a brothel.

369
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,606
I'm going to stop it.

370
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:54,269
There's a number of men in there.
Isn't it rather rash to go in now?

371
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,639
You know Mr Davidson very little.

372
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,083
If you think that fear
of physical danger ..

373
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,678
Is going to stop him in the
performance of his duties.

374
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,399
Stop! This has gone far enough!

375
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:07,652
Hey!

376
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:09,012
Boys, the skids!

00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,153
Get out of here!

The next time, I'll get sore.

They'll be no next time.

380

If you bust into a lady's room you ought
to get someone to introduce you, fellah.

381
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:23,260
Fall in, sweetheart.

Hello, Doc.
- Hello.

388
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:35,547
Been out for a walk?

389
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:36,875
About two steps.

390
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,730
Like walking through a hot pea soup.

391
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,327
What time of day is it?

392
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,119
Going on six.

393
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,176
A whole hour to put in before dinner.

394
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:47,606
Been to the hospital today?
- No.

395
00:23:48,234 --> 00:23:49,381
Davidson's too busy.

396
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,259
Nothing left to do but
twiddle my thumbs.

397
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:53,758
Why twiddle?

398
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,438
Forced idleness makes them restive.

Back in Illinois where I was raised.

400
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:04,216
It was generally believed that a person
who stayed away from business ..

401
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:07,032
More than one working
day in every ten years ..

402
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:11,208
Was a loose, dangerous
and depraved character.

403
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,717
You don't see a bottle around
here anywhere do you, Doc?

404
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:20,329
Have a drink.

405
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:23,598
Not just now.

00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:25,685
Well, the offer still holds.

407
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,481
There's more in the store.

408
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:29,138
Now what was I saying?

409
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,612
The subject I believe, was
the evil of too much work.

410
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:32,747
So it was.

411
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:36,520
There is a lot too much misdirected
energy in this world, doctor.

412
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,349
Are you speaking biographically
or autobiographically?

413
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:40,569
Confidentially.

414
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:43,409
That was a mighty foolish
thing Davidson did.

415
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:46,862
That girl Sadie Thompson
wasn't doing any harm.

416
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,515
I see what you're getting at.

00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,643
He's been after me for
letting her have a room.

418
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,136
It's your own house, isn't it?

419
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,739
Yes. But people like that
have got a lot of influence.

420
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,177
Once they get down on a trader ..

421
00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:59,087
You might as well shut up shop and quit.

422
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:02,499
Surely he isn't asking you to turn
this poor girl out into the rain?

423
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:04,249
No, not exactly.

424
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,841
He knows there would be no place
for her to go except a native hut.

425
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,193
But I think she'd do better
to go to one than stay here.

426
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:12,827
Now that he's on to her.

427
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,616
Just what does he want you to do?

428
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,089
Well, he said he wanted to
be fair to her and to me.

429
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:19,821
But he wouldn't stand for any doings.

430
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:23,698
What do you think, Horn? Is she
out of Ibolé, that Honolulu place?

431
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,601
I don't know and I don't care.

432
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,118
What if she is.

433
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:30,035
We've all crossed thresholds
we don't brag about.

434
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:48,393
Hello, doctor.
- Good evening.

435
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:52,617
Evening, Joe.

436
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:56,593
My, the merry waters look
sure to carry on, aren't they.

437
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:58,705
Let's not mention the heat.

438
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:03,102
Just got around to getting myself
dressed and soon it's time to go to bed.

439
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:07,835
I've played solitaire all afternoon to
try and decide what to have for supper.

440
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:09,435
Tuna fish or beans.

441
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:11,763
And beans won.

442
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,973
Then I played beans against tamales.

443
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:17,575
Just for something to do,
and tamales got to win.

444
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:19,631
Got any canned tamales, Mr Horn?

445
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:22,287
I guess so. Poke around
until you find them.

446
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:27,642
Oh no hurry. Lots of time.

447
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:31,416
There's so much time lying
loose around this island.

448
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:34,019
Somebody ought to bottle it up and
send it back where they need some.

449
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:38,377
You don't mind do you, as
we're here all by ourselves ..

450
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:40,429
If I sit down and have a
skag with you boys?

451
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:41,865
Not at all.
- Have a drink.

452
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:42,973
Thanks.

453
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:48,340
You haven't seen that Marine Sergeant
around that I call "Handsome" have you?

454
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:50,798
No. He hasn't been around today.

455
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:53,960
Oh, it don't matter.

456
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:55,961
I just want to ask him something.

457
00:26:56,964 --> 00:26:59,352
If you do see him, tell him to
drop round this evening, will you.

458
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,730
You know what I said to you last night?

459
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,547
As friend-to-friend, get me?

460
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,614
I'd go slow on company for a day or two.

461
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:08,557
I see.

462
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:11,161
Until Davidson gets over his
terrible experience, huh?

463
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,796
So you think I've been to
blame for what happened?

464
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:16,119
I ain't blaming anyone.

465
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,115
Pushing himself in on us that way.

466
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:21,132
What harm were we doing?
Just talking and singing.

467
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:24,505
Not a word or thought out of the way,
when bang goes the door and in he comes.

468
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:26,173
Knocking the phonograph over.

469
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,707
Here, I said. Quit that!

470
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:29,875
And then he began to ball us out.

471
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:32,980
The boys naturally thought he'd gone
crazy so they put the skids under him.

472
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,102
I know.

473
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:37,549
Anyway, I wouldn't attract his attention
any more than I had to just now.

474
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:41,717
Well, if it comes to that,
he'd better not attract mine.

475
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,560
I've never known anyone
like him, and I don't want to.

476
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,047
Say.

477
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:51,894
What kind of an egg is the Governor
of this place? Do you know?

478
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,613
The Governor?
- Yes.       - Let's see.

479
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:57,197
Oh, a pretty good sort, I'd say. Why?

480
00:27:58,921 --> 00:27:59,738
Oh nothing.

481
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,756
I just wanted to know. That's all.

482
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:04,805
The nerve of him.

483
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,913
Going to see the Governor about me.
Did you ever hear the like of it?

484
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:09,835
How do you know he went
to see him about you?

485
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:10,937
O'Hara told me.

486
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:13,544
He's reported O'Hara to
his office for the drinking.

487
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,688
I don't want that boy to get
into any trouble through me.

488
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:19,181
Oh, I guess O'Hara can
take care of himself.

489
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:21,476
Yeah? Well, so can I
if it comes to that.

490
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,902
Miss Thompson, I'd be careful.
- Of what?

491
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,922
I'd be careful for my own good.

492
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:27,303
You can't tell.

493
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,786
Give me strength.

494
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:33,575
How many times have I to tell you that
old bustard don't mean a thing to me.

495
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:36,018
If he minds his own
business, I'll mind mine.

496
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:39,219
And if he's looking for trouble,
I'll see that he gets it. That's all.

497
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:43,334
Mr Davidson's opinion
of people is never wrong.

498
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:44,855
Oh really?

499
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:49,751
We seem to hear the winds of
reform whistling down the chimney.

500
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,787
Whereas the low hussy
frolics off to buy her supper.

501
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:58,862
Where do you keep your
canned tamales, partner?

502
00:28:58,962 --> 00:29:01,379
If there is any left, you'll find
them on that shelf by the door.

503
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:11,483
Anyway. There is no ill-feeling
between any of us, is there?

504
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:15,126
Well, I wouldn't say the
Doc has been exactly chatty.

505
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:21,266
Life just teems with quiet bonds.

506
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:27,792
Has Mr Davidson returned yet?
- Not yet, Mrs Davidson.

507
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,516
How is the headache? Any better?

508
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:30,833
Very little.

509
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:38,725
Ah ..

510
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:41,300
That girl. Miss Thompson.

511
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:43,922
I have an idea she's
sorry for what happened.

512
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,757
If she knew what she'd really
done, she'd be sorrier still.

513
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:52,316
Mr Davidson has a wonderful heart.

514
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:54,971
And no-one has ever
gone to him in trouble ..

515
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:56,653
Without being comforted.

516
00:29:57,343 --> 00:29:59,599
But he has no mercy for sin.

517
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:02,186
Did you find your tamales, Sadie?
- Yep.

518
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:04,836
Don't look around. Here she comes now.

519
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:08,833
Yes, here I come now.
Why shouldn't I come now?

520
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:10,707
See here, let's settle this.

521
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:13,225
I'm paying for my own room
here. Isn't that so, Mr Horn?

522
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,572
That's so, Miss Thompson.

523
00:30:14,672 --> 00:30:17,661
Will you kindly tell your guests then I
have as much right here as they have.

524
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,192
Now Miss Thompson, there isn't
anyone saying you haven't.

525
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,001
Don't look at her. Don't speak to her.

526
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:27,878
Nah, I wouldn't if I was you.

527
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:36,836
She is brazen.

528
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,066
Outrageous.
- Don't.

529
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:40,587
You'll only harm yourself.

530
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,196
Oh, it's foolish I know.

531
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:48,429
But it is the first time I have ever had
words with a woman of .. that sort.

532
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:51,634
Well there is one comfort.

533
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:54,858
We shan't have to suffer this
sort of thing much longer.

534
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:58,298
Mr Davidson is attending to that.

535
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:04,884
Hello, Davidson.

536
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,417
Alfred, please change your wet clothes.

537
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,120
No. I shall be going out again probably.
- Again?

538
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,226
Oh Alfred, you must
try to get a little rest.

539
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:15,652
Alfred, you must.

540
00:31:16,032 --> 00:31:17,171
My wife, like Martha.

541
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,559
Thou hast troubled thyself
about many things.

542
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,166
But mostly about me.

543
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:24,188
I do not know what I should ever
have done without my dear wife.

544
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,471
In the early days of our island work.

545
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,598
It was she who gave me the
strength and courage to go on.

546
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:32,672
Alfred.

547
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:35,882
Just before you got back,
that girl spoke to me.

548
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,440
She jeered and screamed at us.

549
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:40,729
What are you going to do about her?

550
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:42,453
Dinner ready bye and bye.

551
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,151
Strange how one's thoughts run to food
when there is nothing else to think of.

552
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,180
It happens there is a
great deal to think of.

553
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,997
This Thompson woman you
say spoke to you?        - Yes.

554
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:54,119
She thrust herself in upon
us with low insults.

555
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:57,326
Well, the Governor tells me
the affair is no concern of his.

556
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:01,376
But if I find her incorrigible,
I shall see to it that he acts.

557
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,492
I'm afraid he has no backbone.

558
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:06,045
I suppose that means he won't
do exactly as you want.

559
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:07,650
Whatever it is you want him to do.

560
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,282
I only want him to do what is right.

561
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,927
There may be differences of
opinion as to what is right.

562
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:13,725
If a man had a gangrenous foot ..

563
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:16,861
Would you have patience with
anyone who hesitates to cut it off?

564
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,008
Gangrene is a matter of fact.
- And is not evil?

565
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:22,199
To me, this always seemed
a matter of opinion.

566
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:25,611
Anyway, the poor thing will only be
here until the boat for Apia goes.

567
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,606
And after she gets to Apia?
- I can't see how that concerns us.

568
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:30,481
That's where you and I differ, doctor.

569
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:32,691
I think it would be
best if I spoke to her.

570
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:34,514
But Alfred, why do you see her?

571
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,210
I cannot act until I have
given her every chance.

572
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:39,080
She will only insult you.

573
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,900
Let her insult me. Let her spit on me.

574
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,527
She has an immortal soul.

575
00:32:42,953 --> 00:32:44,805
And I must do all in
my power to save it.

576
00:32:56,936 --> 00:32:58,495
Miss Thompson, I want to talk to you.

577
00:32:58,734 --> 00:32:59,930
I'm eating my supper.

578
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,713
I'll wait until you're through.

579
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,429
Well I guess it is something
that can stand by if it's important.

580
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,715
Miss Thompson, I have
come to make you a gift.

581
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:27,193
The most precious
gift that life can offer.

582
00:33:29,252 --> 00:33:31,792
You want to give me something?
- Yes, I want to give you something.

583
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,201
I guess I'm not following you.
- The gift I offer is free.

584
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:43,940
I don't know why I get all this
attention from you, Mr Davidson.

585
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:46,786
I guess you mean well.

586
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:51,541
I think I can worry along as I've been
worrying along these several years.

587
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:54,248
I go my own way and
don't ask any favors.

588
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,310
Those who have the key of
salvation offered them ..

589
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,661
And fail to open the
door must be destroyed.

590
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:02,223
I see what you mean.

591
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,795
But I won't get destroyed.

592
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,129
I'll always make out one way or another.

593
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:12,123
If that's all Mr Davidson, I'll
go on eating .. I'm hungry.

594
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:14,178
You are hungry for
the bread of the spirit.

595
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:16,334
You are thirsty for the
waters of eternal life.

596
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,098
You mean right by me
Mr Davidson, and I'm grateful.

597
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:23,748
Especially after what
happened the other day.

598
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:25,609
You know.

599
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:27,525
Just between ourselves.

600
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,246
I had a feeling you were meaning to
get me for that little trouble we had.

601
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,102
I felt awful bad about it and
I've been wanting to apologize.

602
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:38,000
I see you are mistaking me,
but I do not think wilfully.

603
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:40,365
They all said you were sore, but ..

604
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:45,060
I didn't think a man as big as you could
hold a grudge over a misunderstanding.

605
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:47,049
This is all beside the
point, Miss Thompson.

606
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:50,986
The thing that concerns me now, is that
you be given your chance before I act.

607
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:55,118
My chance for what?
- Your chance to be saved.

608
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,014
Oh, I'm alright.

609
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,431
Don't you worry about me a bit.

610
00:35:05,107 --> 00:35:07,440
You see, I'm a happy-go-lucky
sort of a fellah.

611
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:10,125
It's true I'm broke now,
but that don't worry me.

612
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,651
I'll be alright as
soon as I get to Apia.

613
00:35:12,972 --> 00:35:14,047
I got friends there.

614
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,040
Yes? What sort of friends?

615
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:18,631
Just friends.

616
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,767
A girl I used to work with lives there.

617
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:24,140
And some American boys
have opened up a sugar plant.

618
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:26,436
She wrote me I could
have a job as cashier.

619
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:27,883
I'm pretty quick at figures.

620
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:29,999
For some time you've lived
in Honolulu, haven't you?

621
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:31,532
What did you do there?

622
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:34,418
I had a job.
- What kind of a job?

623
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,785
Well.

624
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,326
Part of the time I had
sort-of a singing job.

625
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,695
My voice ain't so bad if
you don't listen too hard.

626
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:44,936
Before you went away to
Honolulu where were you?

627
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,311
Where'd I come from, you mean?
- Yes. Where did you come from?

628
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:49,945
Well.

629
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:52,900
I was born in Kennesaw, Kansas,
if that means anything.

630
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,640
Ma and Pa got the California fever ..

631
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,504
So they sold the farm and bought
a ranch just outside Los Angeles.

632
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:00,990
I was about fifteen then, I guess.

633
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:02,556
Then Ma died.

634
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,952
Pa and I didn't get along so well
so I went up to San Francisco.

635
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:08,909
I worked there up until the
time I went to Honolulu.

636
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:10,655
What made you go away to Honolulu?

637
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:13,531
I don't know.

638
00:36:13,977 --> 00:36:16,127
I wanted a change, I suppose.
- Oh, you wanted a change.

639
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:18,250
Well, Sadie Thompson,
this gift I have to offer you.

640
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,911
What are you going to do about it?

641
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,895
Do about it?

642
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,042
I don't know.

643
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:29,342
I don't know what you're talking about.

644
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,360
See here.

645
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,583
I told you I wasn't asking
anything from anybody.

646
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,984
I can take care of myself.

647
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,784
Up or down, in jack or broke.
What's the odds?

648
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:43,809
Where every night takes me, that's
my resting place. That's my way.

649
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,889
Thank you though, for your interest.

650
00:36:49,346 --> 00:36:50,762
Kind of you after what happened.

651
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:53,698
I'm mighty glad you're
not sore at me because ..

652
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:55,660
Well, I like to keep
friends with everybody.

653
00:36:57,996 --> 00:36:59,926
Miss Thompson, I see I
must be patient with you.

654
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:03,313
I see I must try and make you
understand, my poor lost child.

655
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:06,007
What happened the other
day is of no importance.

656
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:10,254
Do you imagine what you or those sailors
said to me makes any difference?

657
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:13,996
You sure are all to the
good, Mr Davidson.

658
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,564
I want to say this.

659
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:18,111
Don't be afraid, because
I'll keep to myself.

660
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:20,182
I know oil and water don't mix.

661
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:23,682
Those ladies in your party won't even
know I'm under the same roof as them.

662
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:26,236
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
Honest I will.

663
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:28,195
Besides.

664
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,810
I don't want any more
black looks from them.

665
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,537
Oh no, you will get no more black
looks from them, my poor child.

666
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:36,476
They're only waiting for the moment
when they can be your friends.

667
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:37,981
To help you with your burden.

668
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:39,167
Oh no.

669
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,692
You don't know the
ladies like I know them.

670
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:46,133
You don't need a spyglass to see those
ladies and me will never be shipmates.

671
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:50,316
This is your chance, Sadie Thompson.

672
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,400
If you will accept your atonement
without resentment or grief ..

673
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,167
The way will be found for you.

674
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:59,045
I'll admit you've got me stalled.

675
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,578
What are you driving at?

676
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:02,374
What have I to atone for?

677
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:03,906
Your life.

678
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:06,954
Mr Davidson.

679
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:08,597
Why do you worry about me?

680
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,816
You've had your own soul and
trust, and you have failed.

681
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:15,609
It is my business to show
you the way to redeem it.

682
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:18,997
Haven't I anything to
say about myself then?

683
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,366
You can choose but one of two paths.

684
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:24,994
What's the second choice?

685
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:26,747
Destruction.

686
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,311
And who is going to "destruct" me?

687
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:34,580
The powers which find no place for evil.

688
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:36,826
And you? What are you going to do?

689
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:37,964
Only my duty.

690
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,290
Yeah, I know. You went to see the
Governor about me, didn't you.

691
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,614
Alright Miss Thompson, I have
been to see the Governor.

692
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:47,490
So all you said just now, about
letting bygones be bygones ..

693
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,707
Calling quits on that bust-up
we had was just a bluff?

694
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:50,617
Be silent!

695
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:53,390
Are you ready to put away your sins?
To live a righteous and decent life?

696
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,253
To pray for forgiveness. If you are not,
be it on your own head.        - Hey!

697
00:38:56,353 --> 00:38:58,264
I shall <i>not</i> let you go
to Apia, Sadie Thompson.

698
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:00,352
You are an evil woman,
you have lived an evil life.

699
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,569
You've come here to carry
your infamy to other places.

700
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:03,613
You're a liar!

701
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:05,919
Who do you think you are standing
there calling me names?

702
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:08,451
Do you deny that you
have escaped from Ibolé?

703
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:10,515
I've listened to you
all I'm going to listen.

704
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:13,376
Now you listen to me. You just
told me I'd better be careful.

705
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:15,273
Well, you'd better be careful yourself.

706
00:39:15,576 --> 00:39:17,993
Lay off me or I'll show you what
it means when I start to get mad.

707
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,773
It will be worse for you if you don't.

708
00:39:23,686 --> 00:39:25,772
The devil in you is strong,
my poor Sadie Thompson.

709
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,967
Evil has claimed you as its own.

710
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,403
You take care of your own evil
and I'll take care of mine.

711
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:32,778
I know what you want.
You want another scalp.

712
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:34,213
Well you don't get mine.

713
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,472
You don't fool me.

714
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,444
You want to make me over your
way, do you. Well you just try it.

715
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:41,278
This is your last chance, Sadie
Thompson. Kneel with me and pray.

716
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:42,545
Let go of me!

717
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:46,049
Sadie Thompson, you are doomed.
- Oh, you make me laugh!

718
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,060
Evening.

719
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:03,081
Young man.

720
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,609
I should not come here if I were you.

721
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:06,680
Why?

722
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:09,804
You are likely to get into more
trouble than you are in already.

723
00:40:10,595 --> 00:40:12,756
This isn't my first year
away from home, ma'am.

724
00:40:12,986 --> 00:40:14,233
I ain't been run over yet.

725
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:17,476
Do you know what kind of
a girl this Sadie Thompson is?

726
00:40:18,405 --> 00:40:19,220
Yes, ma'am.

727
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,099
My advice to you is to keep
away from bad company.

728
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:27,173
Bad company present.

729
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:32,796
You will excuse us, won't you.

730
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:36,880
Mr Horn.

731
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:51,570
What's the matter?

732
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,119
You look low.
- Low?

733
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:55,929
Maybe.

734
00:40:57,836 --> 00:40:59,131
It's this rain, I guess.

735
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:02,648
It makes me jumpy.

736
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:06,388
It makes me want to knock
my head against the wall.

737
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:08,422
It's worse when it don't rain.

738
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:11,195
When the sun comes out for a minute,
you think you're in a steam room.

739
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:13,706
You ought to try getting out for a walk.

740
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:15,253
I was out this morning.

741
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:18,394
I went to see that half-caste
family you told me about.

742
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:24,640
They slammed the door in my face so
fast you'd have thought I had smallpox.

743
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,669
Being an orphan is a wonderful thing.

744
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:30,277
Sadie, please.

745
00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:32,718
Do you want to get me in a jam?
- Okay, Joe.

746
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:34,572
Thank you, Sadie.

747
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:46,497
Listen to it.

748
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,722
Don't it make you want to scream.

749
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:52,742
And when you do scream,
what good does it do you?

750
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:55,243
You haven't any strength left.

751
00:41:56,088 --> 00:41:56,992
Feel hopeless.

752
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,439
Miserable.

753
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:00,420
Don't talk like that, Miss Sadie.

754
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,785
It don't sound like you.
- Oh forget it.

755
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:05,629
I've got the shakes, I guess.

756
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,709
I'll get over it.

757
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:10,653
You see.

758
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,321
I just had a run-in with that Davidson.

759
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:14,805
Yeah? What about?

760
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:17,576
He's not going to let me
go to Apia, so he says.

761
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:20,321
And anyone can see
with two glass eyes ..

762
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:23,272
That this side of the equator,
he's in right and I'm in wrong.

763
00:42:25,505 --> 00:42:29,620
The only thing I can't figure out is
what devil's trick he'll use to stop me.

764
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:32,867
I don't see what he can do.
- No. Neither do I.

765
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:35,013
And we don't say it
with bells, either of us.

766
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:39,267
You know, there is something about
that old crow that isn't human.

767
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:41,453
Deep.

768
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:42,853
Creepy.

769
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:45,401
I guess it's his eyes.

770
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:49,209
They seem to look right into you
and know what you're thinking.

771
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,359
Something tells me I'm going
to need friends soon, Handsome.

772
00:42:57,681 --> 00:42:58,802
Far from home.

773
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,836
You just keep your chin up.
It will be alright.

774
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:04,819
Yeah, but it is not
knowing what's going on.

775
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,644
Being here alone.

776
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:10,284
Rain.

777
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,948
I feel about so big.

778
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:16,734
Like a kid feels in a bad dream.

779
00:43:17,823 --> 00:43:19,933
Things coming at you.
You yelling for help.

780
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:21,432
Nobody hears you.

781
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:24,492
Well any time you call for help,
I'm right here. Don't you forget that.

782
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:26,474
Thanks, Handsome.

783
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:27,807
Say, look here.

784
00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:29,543
If something should go wrong.

785
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:32,146
That is .. about you getting to Apia.

786
00:43:32,594 --> 00:43:33,582
What will you do?

787
00:43:33,848 --> 00:43:35,178
You might as well make plans.

788
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:36,807
What will I do?

789
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:39,340
You mean, you're afraid
something will go wrong?

790
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,677
Oh, no. But if that old nose-pusher
gets around the Governor somehow.

791
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:44,494
And they do stop you somehow.

792
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:45,855
What will you do?

793
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:48,483
I don't know.

794
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,435
Go back to the States, I suppose?

795
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:51,284
No!

796
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:54,348
There is no way they could
make me go back, is there?

797
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:56,325
I don't see how, unless you want to.

798
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,732
Well, I don't want to
go back to the States.

799
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:00,236
Yet awhile.

800
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,822
Might not be bad to run
back and see your folks.

801
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:05,165
I haven't any folks.

802
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,707
Going back to the States
doesn't mean anything to me.

803
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:12,083
It don't to me neither.

804
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,779
Why, what's the matter, Miss Sadie?

805
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:19,570
I won't go back!
They can't make me, can they?

806
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:22,676
You don't want to go to Honolulu
either, I suppose?         - No.

807
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:24,891
You could go to Sidney.

808
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:27,185
Australia?

809
00:44:27,949 --> 00:44:29,884
Why would I do that?
- Work is easy to get.

810
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:31,483
Living is cheap, they say.

811
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:34,253
I'd head that way instead
of Apia if I were you.

812
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:36,990
You think I'd do better there?

813
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,802
You'd never get much
of anywhere in Apia.

814
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:40,656
Worst spot in the world, they say.

815
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,852
And hot, holy bilge-water.

816
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,091
I never thought of Sidney.

817
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,734
Can I get there from here?
- There's a boat, twice a month.

818
00:44:49,195 --> 00:44:51,612
I'm headed that way just as soon
as I've shed these hash marks.

819
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,398
That will be a month and three days.

820
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:56,295
What you going to do there, Handsome?
- Going into the building business.

821
00:44:56,395 --> 00:44:58,526
An old shipmate of mine has
a place and wants a partner.

822
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,062
These three years left he's been at me
to get a discharge and come in with him.

823
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:03,650
You'd like Lefty.

824
00:45:03,978 --> 00:45:06,269
Me and him joined the service
same time twelve years ago.

825
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:09,592
I'm glad you're fixed, Handsome.

826
00:45:09,883 --> 00:45:11,382
You ought to do fine.
- You know.

827
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:13,626
Two times, Lefty and me joined on.

828
00:45:14,066 --> 00:45:16,454
When it comes to number
three .. nix says he.

829
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,399
"Guess what I'm going to do" says Lefty.

830
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,098
Well, I knew without guessing.

831
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,078
So I stood up with him and the bride.

832
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,254
And they shoved off to Sidney
with me throwing the rice.

833
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:27,749
I'll bet you'll be glad to see him.

834
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,314
If you should go to Sidney.

835
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,641
Lefty and Maggie will put
you right about what to do.

836
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:36,878
Yeah? And can't I just hear Lefty's wife
yelping with joy at the sight of me.

837
00:45:37,786 --> 00:45:39,588
You haven't any cause
to worry about Maggie.

838
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:41,325
You two would get along swell.

839
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,963
Baby boy, I know females.

840
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:45,330
You don't.

841
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:47,543
I got an idea what's on your mind.

842
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:49,601
But Maggie ain't the kind
of a dame you mean.

843
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,281
She's square from the toes up.

844
00:45:51,596 --> 00:45:52,497
A funny thing.

845
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,281
Them that kick highest always
seem to settle down hardest.

846
00:45:58,977 --> 00:46:02,044
You mean this Maggie was sort-of
gay before Lefty came along?

847
00:46:02,308 --> 00:46:03,673
Lefty met her in Honolulu.

848
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:06,419
They were both nuts over each
other right from the start.

849
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:08,989
It never mattered to either of
them that they met in Ibolé.

850
00:46:11,424 --> 00:46:12,317
In Ibolé?

851
00:46:13,068 --> 00:46:13,711
Yeah.

852
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:16,616
Knowing the worst to begin with
isn't always the worst way to begin.

853
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:19,043
Of course.

854
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,386
If there is some reason
why you're set for Apia.

855
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,673
If.

856
00:46:22,943 --> 00:46:24,978
If there is someone you're
wanting to see there ..

857
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:27,578
I .. I wouldn't want to persuade you.

858
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:31,396
Ha .. I'm not looking forward
to Apia with any wild joy.

859
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,113
Then there is another thing.
If you go to Sidney now.

860
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:36,154
I'll be over inside a few weeks.

861
00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:39,717
Not that that might mean
so much to you, maybe.

862
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,847
I haven't so many friends, Handsome.
But I can do with one more.

863
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:52,106
You know, you're an awful
funny fellow, Handsome.

864
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,110
I guess I'm the dumbo king alright.

865
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:01,896
Have they any kids?

866
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:03,442
Who?

867
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:05,608
Those friends of yours in Sidney.

868
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:08,293
Oh .. I was thinking of something else.

869
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,056
Yep .. two.

870
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:11,950
How about it?

871
00:47:13,304 --> 00:47:14,651
Huh? How about what?

872
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:16,853
Changing your route and
going to Sidney instead.

873
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,844
Sure. Why not.

874
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:21,212
I guess no-one can stop
me from doing that.

875
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,674
What a Simp' I was getting
the wind up all over nothing.

876
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:28,029
There I was jumping with the
shakes and nervous as a witch ..

877
00:47:28,206 --> 00:47:30,459
Because that dismal bum
wouldn't let me go to Apia.

878
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:33,234
Well Apia, my foot. It's Sidney for me.

879
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:35,109
What do you want?
- Letter.

880
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:36,588
You may go.

881
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,110
It's for you.

882
00:47:39,953 --> 00:47:40,662
For me?

883
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:42,159
Who is writing <i>me</i> a letter?

884
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:48,060
It's from the Governor's office.

885
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:49,820
You'd better open it.

886
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:05,579
What's the matter?

887
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:08,570
I won't go back! They can't make me.

888
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:09,749
There is reasons.

889
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,894
I've got some rights, haven't I?
- What's the matter?

890
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:14,176
The Governor has ordered
me back to San Francisco.

891
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:16,641
Now don't get nervous.
I'll tell you what you do.

892
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:20,188
Go see the Governor. Ask him to let you
stay here until the Sidney boat leaves.

893
00:48:20,454 --> 00:48:22,277
Only be 3 or 4 more days.
- He'll see me?

894
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:25,182
Hurry, before he goes to supper. Only
a few steps. You want me to go with you?

895
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:26,964
Yeah, wait. I'll get my coat.

896
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:44,436
So, you're back are you.
You low-down skunk!

897
00:48:44,903 --> 00:48:46,883
What have you been telling
the Governor about me?

898
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:49,309
I've been hoping to have another
talk with you, Miss Thompson.

899
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:51,056
Why you miserable snail-snatcher.

900
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:54,100
I wouldn't talk to you if you and me
were the only two people left on earth.

901
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:57,107
Why, you're so doggone mean it
makes me sick even to look at you.

902
00:48:57,462 --> 00:48:58,779
That's what I think of you.

903
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:01,357
Coming to me with all that guff
you spilled about salvation.

904
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:03,573
Then going and having
me deported on top of it.

905
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:04,888
Why you low ..
- Sadie!

906
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:07,553
I am wholly indifferent to the abuse
you think fit to heap upon me.

907
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,069
Telling that Governor a lot
of filthy lies about me.

908
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,791
And now this comes.
I've got to beat it on the next boat.

909
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:15,342
You can hardly expect him to let
you stay under the circumstances.

910
00:49:15,442 --> 00:49:18,516
What did the Governor know or care until
you went and put your hooks into me?

911
00:49:18,857 --> 00:49:21,917
It's you that did it. You did it all.
- I will not deceive you, Miss Thompson.

912
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,444
I urged the Governor to take the only
steps consistent with his obligations.

913
00:49:25,544 --> 00:49:27,957
Well, why couldn't you let me be?
Was I doing you any harm?

914
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:30,794
You may rest assured, if you had been
I would be the last one to resent it.

915
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,135
You don't think I want to stay
in this rain-hole, do you?

916
00:49:33,235 --> 00:49:35,262
You're being given every
opportunity of getting out.

917
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:38,056
Come on Sadie, don't say any more.
- You. I know your kind.

918
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:39,885
You dirty, two-faced mutt.

919
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:42,969
I bet when you were a kid you
caught flies and tore their wings off.

920
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:47,101
I bet you stuck pins in frogs to see 'em
wiggle and flap and read 'em a lecture.

921
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:48,263
I know you!

922
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:51,152
Why, you'd tear the heart out of your
grandma if she didn't think your way.

923
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:54,012
And tell her you were saving her soul.
You're something incredible!

924
00:49:56,855 --> 00:49:59,214
You will be glad to hear that
the Governor has acted at last.

925
00:49:59,782 --> 00:50:00,801
He's a weak man.

926
00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:04,098
For days he has shilly-shallied,
saying it was none of his concern.

927
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:06,158
I can readily see why.

928
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:08,046
How did you convince him?

929
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,519
I finally had to speak
straight from the shoulder.

930
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:16,115
The foundation that I represent in
Washington is not without influence.

931
00:50:16,755 --> 00:50:18,942
Miss Thompson will sail on
the next boat that goes.

932
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:20,438
How soon will that be?

933
00:50:20,538 --> 00:50:22,723
The Golden Gate is due here
from Sidney next Tuesday.

934
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,952
She will sail on that.

935
00:50:25,895 --> 00:50:27,237
Four days more.

936
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:29,915
Are you ready?

937
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:39,353
Well .. that's settled Sadie
Thompson's hash, I guess.

938
00:50:48,056 --> 00:50:50,720
Mrs Davidson tells me she
hasn't closed her eyes ..

939
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,881
Ever since that girl came to
live under the same roof as her.

940
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:56,844
The founder of her religion
wasn't so squeamish.

941
00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:59,431
Don't joke about such
things please, Robert.

942
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,333
Excuse me, Doc.
Miss Thompson isn't feeling well.

943
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,385
Will you see her for a moment?
- Certainly.

944
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:08,882
She's right out here.

945
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,867
Sorry you're not feeling well.

946
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,572
I'm well enough. Not really sick.

947
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:25,151
O'Hara said that just
because I had to see you.

948
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:26,408
Yes, Miss Thompson?

949
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:28,284
I got to get back for inspection now.

950
00:51:28,988 --> 00:51:30,032
I'll see you later.

951
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,468
Keep your chin up.
- Thanks, Handsome.

952
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:39,212
Lucky meeting you, Serge.
- What's up?

953
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,240
Hey, what have you been doing, lately?

954
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,876
You're booked for the Brig.
- That's right, Serge.

955
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:44,959
Fall in.

956
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:46,497
Okay.

957
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:49,243
I don't know exactly what I can do.

958
00:51:50,229 --> 00:51:53,688
I thought you could ask him if he'd
let me wait and go to Sidney instead.

959
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:55,318
It's only 3 or 4 days longer.

960
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:56,740
I'll ask him.

961
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,814
Tell him I can get work
in Sidney. Straight stuff.

962
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,761
Tell him I just can't go back to
San Francisco now. There is reasons.

963
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:03,259
Will you, please?

964
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:05,876
I'll do what I can.
- Thank you.

965
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:07,431
Thank you.

966
00:52:09,203 --> 00:52:10,199
Oh, Davidson.

967
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,585
What is it, doctor?

968
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:14,092
I want to speak to you about
something. Shall I come up?

969
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:15,808
No, I'll come right down.

970
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:18,485
Tell him I ask his pardon.
Tell him I'm sorry.

971
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,524
Better get into your room
now, Miss Thompson.

972
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,572
Well doctor, what can I do for you?

973
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:29,984
It's about Miss Thompson.

974
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:33,280
The Governor has told her
that if you have no objection ..

975
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,043
He will allow her to remain here until
she can take the boat for Sidney.

976
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:38,825
I'm sorry, doctor. But it is
useless to discuss the matter.

977
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:42,316
It appears the girl has reasons for not
wanting to return to San Francisco.

978
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:45,756
I don't see that it makes any difference
if she goes to Sidney instead.

979
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:47,670
It's only a matter of a few days.

980
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,895
Well, you mean this interference
for the best, but my mind is made up.

981
00:52:51,597 --> 00:52:54,211
You want to know what I think?
I think you're harsh and tyrannical.

982
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:57,155
I'm terribly sorry you should
think that of me, doctor.

983
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:00,706
Believe me, my heart bleeds for
that unfortunate young woman.

984
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:04,232
But I cannot find it in my
conscience to change my decision.

985
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:07,155
However if the Governor wishes
to do so on his own account.

986
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,362
That is his business.
- He won't.

987
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,740
And you know why.

988
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:15,314
Please don't bear any malice towards me
because I cannot accede to your wish.

989
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:18,063
I respect very much, Dr Macphail.

990
00:53:18,631 --> 00:53:20,711
And I should be sorry indeed
if you thought ill of me.

991
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:23,597
I've no doubt you have a sufficiently
good opinion of yourself ..

992
00:53:23,762 --> 00:53:25,302
To bear mine with equanimity.

993
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:41,439
I'm sorry.

994
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,423
Don't give up hope, Miss Thompson.

995
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,516
I think it's a shame the
way they're treating you.

996
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:51,527
I'll go and see the Governor myself.

997
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:53,497
Will you?

998
00:53:55,419 --> 00:53:56,674
Will you now?
- Now.

999
00:53:56,895 --> 00:53:58,980
Oh you're awful good. Awful good.

1000
00:54:00,326 --> 00:54:02,196
You don't know what
this means to me, doctor.

1001
00:54:02,296 --> 00:54:04,383
Don't cry, Miss Thompson.
I think I can do something.

1002
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:05,414
God bless you.

1003
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:39,940
Let me tell you something.

1004
00:54:40,818 --> 00:54:43,011
Mr Davidson is one of them big Atua.

1005
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:44,862
What's that?

1006
00:54:45,656 --> 00:54:46,731
What are you saying?

1007
00:54:47,236 --> 00:54:49,674
All the same, I know. He big Atua.

1008
00:55:01,502 --> 00:55:02,714
What's she saying?

1009
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:04,411
What were you saying, Ameena?

1010
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:06,808
All the same, I know.

1011
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:08,866
He big Atua.

1012
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:10,379
A witchdoctor.

1013
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:12,862
A species of wizard, you perceive.

1014
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,366
Knew everything, saw everything.

1015
00:55:16,087 --> 00:55:17,821
Lives by the power of God.

1016
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:21,370
A real goat charm had no charms for him.

1017
00:55:21,993 --> 00:55:25,251
When hungry, he simply ferreted
out a devil and ate him up for tea.

1018
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:26,269
Ah, cut it!

1019
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:28,838
That kind of talk gives me the willies.

1020
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,507
Let me have a drink will you, Joe.

1021
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:41,426
That's Davidson up there isn't it?

1022
00:55:42,021 --> 00:55:44,257
Sounds like his voice.
- What's he saying?

1023
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:46,731
He said: "Amen".

1024
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,793
Either that stuff is
jinxed or I am, Horn.

1025
00:55:58,248 --> 00:55:59,438
I can't seem to feel it.

1026
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:02,839
Maybe the Atua is after me.

1027
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:06,697
What is it the old thing does?

1028
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,924
Sees everything.

1029
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:10,493
Knows everything.

1030
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:16,010
You know.

1031
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:19,364
That's the kind of an eye
Davidson has alright.

1032
00:56:21,246 --> 00:56:23,887
He looks right into you.
He knows what you're trying to hide.

1033
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:29,930
I guess it wouldn't be any use to try
and hide much from him, would it.

1034
00:56:30,831 --> 00:56:31,786
Not much.

1035
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:39,513
What did he say?

1036
00:56:40,408 --> 00:56:41,623
I'm sorry, Miss Thompson.

1037
00:56:44,498 --> 00:56:45,427
That's alright.

1038
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,929
Thanks, just the same.

1039
00:57:28,975 --> 00:57:30,594
I'm sorry for what I said to you today.

1040
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:32,832
For everything that's happened,
I ask a pardon.

1041
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:36,001
I guess my back is broad enough
to bear a few hard words.

1042
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:38,122
You got me beat.

1043
00:57:38,928 --> 00:57:39,747
I'm all in.

1044
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,189
Oh don't make me go back
to San Francisco, please.

1045
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:43,816
I'll go anywhere else you say.

1046
00:57:44,049 --> 00:57:45,579
Why don't you want to go back there?

1047
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:49,423
My folks live there.

1048
00:57:49,617 --> 00:57:51,525
I guess I don't want them
to see me like this.

1049
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,075
I understood you had no people.

1050
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:55,347
I got a father.

1051
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:58,494
But you told me yourself your
father did not live in San Francisco.

1052
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,814
That's not the reason, Miss Thompson.

1053
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:03,898
What's the reason you
don't want to go back there?

1054
00:58:03,998 --> 00:58:05,830
I told you.
- No, no. You haven't told me.

1055
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:08,004
Well.

1056
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:09,276
It's this way.

1057
00:58:10,262 --> 00:58:11,627
I'm trying to go straight now.

1058
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,768
If I go back there, I can't go straight.

1059
00:58:14,162 --> 00:58:16,591
What will prevent you from going
straight if you really want to?

1060
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,581
There is a man back
there who won't let me.

1061
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:19,782
Why won't he let you?

1062
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,678
He just won't.

1063
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:22,910
You see.

1064
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:24,306
It's this way.

1065
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,601
I'm scared of him getting me again.

1066
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:28,193
Who is this man?

1067
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:29,314
Well ..

1068
00:58:30,113 --> 00:58:31,478
A sort of a politician.

1069
00:58:31,873 --> 00:58:34,410
And you fear his influence, eh?
- Yes. Yes, that's it.

1070
00:58:34,892 --> 00:58:37,204
You see, he's bad and I'm scared of him.

1071
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,690
Does he need to know
that you have returned?

1072
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:40,884
Oh, he'll know.

1073
00:58:41,379 --> 00:58:43,627
Miss Thompson,
San Francisco is a big place.

1074
00:58:44,364 --> 00:58:47,182
It should not be difficult for you to
keep out of his way if you want to.

1075
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:49,888
Well .. I'll have to get help
once I get back and ..

1076
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:52,390
The only people that will
help me are in with him.

1077
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:54,385
If you earnestly
desire to go straight ..

1078
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:57,233
It will not be necessary for you to
go to your former friends for help.

1079
00:58:57,936 --> 00:59:00,285
My foundation will help you
until you are on your feet.

1080
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:03,081
This man you fear need never
know that you were in the city.

1081
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:05,556
Oh he'll know. All the boat
coming in are being watched.

1082
00:59:07,015 --> 00:59:09,587
You mean to tell me that every boat
coming into port will be watched ..

1083
00:59:09,687 --> 00:59:11,194
On the chance that <i>you</i> are on it?

1084
00:59:13,403 --> 00:59:14,057
Yes.

1085
00:59:14,244 --> 00:59:17,081
Come, Miss Thompson.
These evasions are getting you nowhere.

1086
00:59:17,883 --> 00:59:20,122
Why are you afraid to
return to San Francisco?

1087
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:22,536
I told you. Because I
can't go straight there.

1088
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:24,567
Can I tell you why you're
afraid to go back?

1089
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:27,426
This "politician" you fear is
a politician in a uniform.

1090
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:28,512
He wears a badge.

1091
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,374
What you fear is the Penitentiary.

1092
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:34,568
Oh don't send me back, please.
I'll be good. Honest I will.

1093
00:59:34,925 --> 00:59:36,975
Is that it, the Penitentiary?
- But I was framed.

1094
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,618
I got away before they caught me.

1095
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:40,769
Gee, they'll nab me the
minute I get off that boat.

1096
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:43,023
It will be three years
for me. Three years.

1097
00:59:43,348 --> 00:59:45,528
Oh give me a chance,
will you? Just one chance.

1098
00:59:45,628 --> 00:59:48,094
I'm going to give you the finest
chance you've ever had.

1099
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,716
I don't have to go back, you mean?
- Yes, you will have to go back.

1100
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,891
You will sail for San Francisco
Tuesday, as the Governor has ordered.

1101
01:00:00,121 --> 01:00:02,603
If you are truly repentant,
you will accept this punishment.

1102
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,179
You will offer it as the
atonement for your sins.

1103
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:08,591
When you want me, Sadie
Thompson, call me. I will come.

1104
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:11,812
At any hour of the day or night,
when you need me I will come.

1105
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,563
I shall be waiting for your call.

1106
01:00:20,425 --> 01:00:21,415
Mr Davidson.

1107
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:22,879
Wait a minute.

1108
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:25,445
You're right, Mr Davidson.

1109
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:26,984
I am bad.

1110
01:00:27,306 --> 01:00:29,147
But I want to be good,
only I don't know how.

1111
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:31,368
So, I tell you what.

1112
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:34,628
You let me stay here with you.
And then you can tell me what to do.

1113
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,896
And no matter what it is,
I'll do it for you.

1114
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:42,646
You can't stay here. You've got to go
back. You've got to serve your time.

1115
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:45,494
You mean to say ..?

1116
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:47,859
If I repent and want to be good.

1117
01:00:48,205 --> 01:00:49,933
I still have to go to the Penitentiary?

1118
01:00:50,226 --> 01:00:51,663
Yes. You've got to go.

1119
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:54,914
Alright.

1120
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:57,162
You send me back there
and that's my finish.

1121
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,746
No. It will be your beginning.

1122
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:00,896
But I was framed, I tell you.

1123
01:01:01,064 --> 01:01:03,195
Innocent or guilty, you have
got to serve your sentence.

1124
01:01:03,422 --> 01:01:06,342
It is the only way you can
prove you are worthy of mercy.

1125
01:01:08,014 --> 01:01:09,458
Innocent or guilty?

1126
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,563
What are you talking about?

1127
01:01:11,914 --> 01:01:12,999
Where's your mercy?

1128
01:01:14,512 --> 01:01:15,241
Ah no ..

1129
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:17,379
I guess that repenting stuff is off.

1130
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:19,477
Was it every "on", Miss Thompson?

1131
01:01:20,113 --> 01:01:21,950
Whether it was or not, it's off now.

1132
01:01:22,572 --> 01:01:24,567
You've got to go back to San Francisco.

1133
01:01:24,851 --> 01:01:26,699
Straight orders from your
private heaven, huh?

1134
01:01:27,427 --> 01:01:28,562
Oh no, Mr Davidson.

1135
01:01:29,142 --> 01:01:31,137
Your God and me could
never be shipmates.

1136
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:34,000
And the next time you talk to him,
you can tell him this from me:

1137
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,328
That Sadie Thompson
is on her way to hell!

1138
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,173
Stop!

1139
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,731
This has gone far enough.

1140
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:40,295
Oh no, it hasn't gone far enough.

1141
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:44,758
You've told me what's wrong with me.
Now I'll tell you what's wrong with you.

1142
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:47,988
You keep yelling at me to be
punished, to go back and suffer.

1143
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,644
How do you know how I've suffered?

1144
01:01:49,744 --> 01:01:51,845
You don't know, you don't
care, and you don't even ask.

1145
01:01:51,945 --> 01:01:53,813
And you call yourself a Christian?

1146
01:01:53,913 --> 01:01:56,444
Why, you're nothing but a miserable
witch-finder, that's what you are.

1147
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:57,832
You believe in torture.

1148
01:01:58,124 --> 01:02:01,098
You know you're big and you know you're
strong and you got the law on your side.

1149
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:03,225
And the power to hang me. Alright!

1150
01:02:03,516 --> 01:02:05,549
But I've got the power to
stand here and say to you:

1151
01:02:05,649 --> 01:02:07,726
Hang me and be <i>damned</i> to you!

1152
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:12,096
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1153
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,205
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory.

1154
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:17,846
For ever and ever.

1155
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:21,862
Oh Lord, here Thou my
prayers for this lost sister.

1156
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,989
Close Thy ears to a wild
and heedless world.

1157
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:27,884
Our Father who art in heaven.

1158
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:29,543
Hallowed be Thy name.

1159
01:02:30,174 --> 01:02:31,526
Thy kingdom come.

1160
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,269
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

1161
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:36,720
Give us this day our daily bread.

1162
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:41,050
Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

1163
01:02:41,616 --> 01:02:44,688
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1164
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:48,046
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory.

1165
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,635
For ever and ever.

1166
01:02:49,943 --> 01:02:50,762
Amen.

1167
01:02:51,325 --> 01:02:53,453
Our Father who art in heaven.

1168
01:02:53,962 --> 01:02:55,486
Hallowed be Thy name.

1169
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:57,654
Thy kingdom come.

1170
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,772
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

1171
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,644
Give us this day our daily bread.

1172
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:07,681
Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

1173
01:03:08,627 --> 01:03:11,910
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1174
01:03:12,405 --> 01:03:15,817
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory.

1175
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:17,696
For ever and ever.

1176
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,920
Amen.

1177
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:21,026
Our Father who art in heaven.

1178
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,309
Hallowed be Thy name.

1179
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:25,659
Thy kingdom come.

1180
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:29,091
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

1181
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:32,266
Give us this day our daily bread.

1182
01:03:32,906 --> 01:03:37,004
Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those that trespass against us.

1183
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,922
Lead us not into temptation.

1184
01:03:40,438 --> 01:03:41,938
But deliver us from evil.

1185
01:03:42,453 --> 01:03:43,891
For Thine is the kingdom.

1186
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,907
The power and the glory.

1187
01:03:46,317 --> 01:03:47,702
For ever and ever.

1188
01:03:48,112 --> 01:03:48,928
Amen.

1189
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,849
You got my clothes?

1190
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:35,180
Everything is here.
- I'll be out in a few minutes.

1191
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:41,735
"<i>Everything goeth,
everything returneth</i>."

1192
01:05:42,556 --> 01:05:44,840
"<i>Eternally rolleth the
wheel of existence</i>."

1193
01:05:45,652 --> 01:05:46,713
"<i>Everything dieth</i>."

1194
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:49,154
"<i>Everything blossometh forth again</i>."

1195
01:05:49,747 --> 01:05:52,138
"<i>Eternally runneth on
the year of existence</i>."

1196
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:54,742
"<i>Thus spake Zarathustra</i>."

1197
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:57,844
Ah, good old Nietzsche.

1198
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:00,043
Be quiet, Joe.

1199
01:06:00,314 --> 01:06:01,433
What do you mean?

1200
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:06,172
Tomorrow, she goeth.

1201
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:08,233
Thus endeth that episode.

1202
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:19,920
I expect we'd better go back.
I have a feeling something is wrong.

1203
01:06:20,295 --> 01:06:21,166
But the ..

1204
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:23,750
Other dances are about to begin.

1205
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:25,409
You ought to be here to prevent them.

1206
01:06:25,509 --> 01:06:29,171
That girl and her salvation are more
important to me now than anything else.

1207
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:30,580
We've got to go.

1208
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,469
If you're not stopping this, Davidson, I
personally want to see it through.

1209
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:34,327
Nonsense.

1210
01:06:34,507 --> 01:06:36,752
Perhaps doctor, you wouldn't
mind escorting the ladies home.

1211
01:06:37,101 --> 01:06:37,978
I must go.

1212
01:06:44,374 --> 01:06:45,258
How is she?

1213
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:46,760
Not so good.

1214
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:50,756
Has she wondered why
I haven't been around?

1215
01:06:51,213 --> 01:06:51,799
No.

1216
01:06:53,011 --> 01:06:55,472
Didn't you tell her, you old pelican,
that they had me in the Brig?

1217
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:56,969
Nope. She didn't ask.

1218
01:06:57,633 --> 01:06:59,260
She didn't ask?
- Nope.

1219
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:01,400
She didn't even inquire about you.

1220
01:07:03,961 --> 01:07:07,208
I'm asking because the last time I
seen her we were pretty good friends.

1221
01:07:08,144 --> 01:07:12,175
You don't suppose do you, that she had
time to think of you or anything else?

1222
01:07:12,768 --> 01:07:15,611
With Davidson getting her ready
to go back to San Francisco.

1223
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:18,262
What's he been doing to her?

1224
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:19,863
Praying.

1225
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:21,117
Praying?

1226
01:07:21,739 --> 01:07:22,505
Praying.

1227
01:07:23,314 --> 01:07:25,214
Got her beached with
the psalms stuff, huh?

1228
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,852
Beached and delirious, I'd say.

1229
01:07:28,526 --> 01:07:31,294
He took pretty good care to get rid
of me before he started, didn't he?

1230
01:07:32,235 --> 01:07:33,736
Well, I'll beat him to it, tonight.

1231
01:07:34,605 --> 01:07:35,677
How did you get out?

1232
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:38,398
Walked out.

1233
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,246
What you doing, O'Hara?

1234
01:07:43,283 --> 01:07:44,900
You arouse my curiosity.

1235
01:07:46,248 --> 01:07:49,953
If I was you I'd ease off to bed with
the old lady and not have any curiosity.

1236
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:53,945
Oh .. you would, would you.

1237
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,926
And why would you do that?

1238
01:07:58,423 --> 01:08:02,013
I'd do that so as I wouldn't be blamed
for anything in case anything happened.

1239
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:04,219
Sounds like another row starting.

1240
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:08,882
The most unlucky day of my life,
the day that Orduna came into port.

1241
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:10,597
Ameena.

1242
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,025
Lock up.

1243
01:08:13,074 --> 01:08:14,175
I like my comforts.

1244
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,622
For five days now.

1245
01:08:16,722 --> 01:08:20,121
This whole household has centred
on that poor Thompson girl in there.

1246
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:23,778
With Davidson and Old Nick
wrestling for her soul.

1247
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:25,605
It's got me nervous.

1248
01:08:26,037 --> 01:08:28,032
Cheer up. It won't center
around her much longer.

1249
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:31,319
What do you know about it?
Safe in the Brig all week.

1250
01:08:32,431 --> 01:08:35,977
There hasn't been such a casting-out of
devils since the first chapter of Exodus.

1251
01:08:37,273 --> 01:08:40,528
The last vestige of mortal sin
lurking in that poor critter's heart ..

1252
01:08:40,713 --> 01:08:41,783
Has been torn out.

1253
01:08:42,675 --> 01:08:45,284
Sadie Thompson, who blew
into my hotel a week ago.

1254
01:08:45,832 --> 01:08:46,733
Isn't anymore.

1255
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,718
Wait until you see her.

1256
01:08:48,818 --> 01:08:50,861
You aren't keeping anything
from me, are you Joe?

1257
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:52,319
Wait until you see her, I say.

1258
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:56,863
She's like a victim they've got trussed
up to sacrifice to some bloody idol.

1259
01:08:57,597 --> 01:08:58,240
Yeah.

1260
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:00,179
It'll make you sick to look at her.

1261
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:02,287
Get her out to me.
I'll tend to the rest of this.

1262
01:09:02,387 --> 01:09:03,180
Gladly.

1263
01:09:03,622 --> 01:09:05,751
My mind is blank save for one thing.

1264
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:09,291
Tomorrow, Miss Sadie Thompson
will be on the high seas.

1265
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:10,883
You bet she'll be.

1266
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:14,418
Miss Thompson, you're wanted.
- Alright.

1267
01:09:29,228 --> 01:09:29,900
Sadie?

1268
01:09:31,128 --> 01:09:32,200
You look awful sick.

1269
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,377
I was wondering whether
I'd see you before I left.

1270
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:39,087
You've been awful kind.

1271
01:09:40,214 --> 01:09:41,229
I'll never forget.

1272
01:09:42,632 --> 01:09:43,704
I want to thank you.

1273
01:09:50,105 --> 01:09:51,125
Look here, Sadie.

1274
01:09:51,334 --> 01:09:52,978
How long will it take you to get packed?

1275
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:55,681
I'm pretty well packed now.
- That's good.

1276
01:09:56,362 --> 01:09:58,150
Griggs and Hodgson
will be along any minute.

1277
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,908
They'll tote your bags.

1278
01:10:00,357 --> 01:10:02,373
You hurry up now and get
dressed as fast as you can.

1279
01:10:03,395 --> 01:10:04,401
Get dressed?

1280
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:06,470
You're leaving this place tonight.

1281
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:11,003
My boat don't leave
until tomorrow morning.

1282
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:13,220
Your boat is leaving tonight.

1283
01:10:13,402 --> 01:10:15,018
And I'm going to see you get aboard it.

1284
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:17,124
I must wait for Mr Davidson.

1285
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,403
He's going to see me onboard.

1286
01:10:20,484 --> 01:10:22,100
Mr Davidson isn't going to see you off.

1287
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:24,927
He isn't?

1288
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:26,764
What's happened?

1289
01:10:27,497 --> 01:10:28,340
Where is he?

1290
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:31,180
You're not going to San Francisco.
That's what's happened.

1291
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:34,287
You are leaving here in a few minutes
for the Samarkan Islands on a junk.

1292
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:37,119
You'll wait there until the Sidney boat
arrives. Then you're going to Sidney.

1293
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,881
But .. what do you suppose
Mr Davidson would say?

1294
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,544
If he came back and found me gone?

1295
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:49,009
You know the old
shouter better than I do.

1296
01:10:49,548 --> 01:10:50,830
I don't mind admitting ..

1297
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:53,588
The sight of his face at that moment
would slip me considerable quiet fun.

1298
01:11:04,082 --> 01:11:06,525
You've had a pretty bad time
these last few days, I guess.

1299
01:11:06,883 --> 01:11:07,812
Just forget it.

1300
01:11:08,145 --> 01:11:09,757
It's mighty sweet and fine of you ..

1301
01:11:10,105 --> 01:11:11,549
To go to all this trouble for me.

1302
01:11:11,952 --> 01:11:13,387
Fine? Fine, nothing.

1303
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,958
This ain't one small bit of what I'd
like to do for you if I got the chance.

1304
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:18,477
You know.

1305
01:11:19,431 --> 01:11:20,446
You're doing this.

1306
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:22,935
Sort-of makes me want to cry.

1307
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:25,325
But ..
- But what?

1308
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,266
I can't do it.

1309
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:29,504
Why can't you do it?

1310
01:11:31,472 --> 01:11:34,333
I'm going through with what
I've got to go through with.

1311
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:36,368
Are you afraid of Davidson?

1312
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:38,917
He'll never get hold of
you again. I'll see to that.

1313
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:40,476
No, that isn't it.

1314
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:45,622
It will be awfully hard for me to make
you understand what's come over me.

1315
01:11:46,717 --> 01:11:50,191
I can't understand it myself,
except that it's happened.

1316
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,561
Sadie .. this sort of thing
don't make you happy.

1317
01:11:53,926 --> 01:11:55,456
You don't realize it ain't yourself.

1318
01:11:56,089 --> 01:11:58,299
You got to forget Mr Davidson .. and ..

1319
01:11:58,998 --> 01:12:00,019
And come with me.

1320
01:12:01,247 --> 01:12:02,176
No, I couldn't.

1321
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:03,684
I couldn't.

1322
01:12:04,603 --> 01:12:06,136
You don't know what you're saying.

1323
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:08,493
You haven't any idea what you're saying.

1324
01:12:08,873 --> 01:12:11,535
They're not going to send you back
there with no-one to take care of you.

1325
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:13,684
In Sidney in a couple of weeks ..

1326
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,883
You'll have me.

1327
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:18,705
Remember what I told you
about Lefty and Maggie?

1328
01:12:18,805 --> 01:12:20,664
I won't listen. I won't listen.

1329
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:24,176
What's to hinder you repenting in
Sidney as well as in San Francisco?

1330
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:25,876
If you got to repent.

1331
01:12:26,095 --> 01:12:27,596
Oh, you don't understand.

1332
01:12:29,707 --> 01:12:30,779
I've got to go back.

1333
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:33,032
And be punished for what I've been.

1334
01:12:34,723 --> 01:12:35,967
What's that you're saying?

1335
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:41,248
When I get back to
San Francisco, Handsome.

1336
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:45,274
I've got to go to the
Penitentiary for 3 years.

1337
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:50,608
Gee.

1338
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,875
Mr Davidson says.

1339
01:12:54,775 --> 01:12:56,323
It doesn't make any difference.

1340
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,459
Whether I was innocent or guilty.

1341
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:01,057
Of what they framed me for.

1342
01:13:02,547 --> 01:13:03,466
He says.

1343
01:13:05,036 --> 01:13:07,972
It's the only way of
letting me square myself.

1344
01:13:09,876 --> 01:13:10,871
He says.

1345
01:13:12,005 --> 01:13:14,524
I've got to accept an unjust punishment.

1346
01:13:14,878 --> 01:13:15,646
By a man.

1347
01:13:16,067 --> 01:13:18,274
As a sacrifice for my sins.

1348
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:22,938
You listen to me. Get into your room and
get your clothes on as fast as you can.

1349
01:13:23,038 --> 01:13:24,778
Let go of me. Let go.

1350
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:27,005
Don't you dare do that again.

1351
01:13:27,602 --> 01:13:29,540
I want you to go away.
Do you hear? Go away.

1352
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:31,229
Sadie, Sadie.
- I mean it.

1353
01:13:31,465 --> 01:13:33,660
Go away.
- Sadie, listen please.

1354
01:13:33,986 --> 01:13:36,359
Oh Handsome, why can't you let me alone?

1355
01:13:36,655 --> 01:13:37,870
Here are the boys, Sadie.

1356
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,864
Come to say goodbye to you.
- No.

1357
01:13:40,172 --> 01:13:42,805
They're going to put your things
aboard the junk for you.     - No, no.

1358
01:13:44,306 --> 01:13:46,210
Why doesn't Mr Davidson come?

1359
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,044
Where is he?

1360
01:13:48,727 --> 01:13:49,584
Where is he?

1361
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,774
See if she's got a coat in that room.
That old fool has got her tranced.

1362
01:13:55,043 --> 01:13:56,948
We're taking her whether
she wants to go or not.

1363
01:14:02,116 --> 01:14:03,822
Oh, they're taking my things.

1364
01:14:04,349 --> 01:14:05,663
They mustn't take my things.

1365
01:14:05,763 --> 01:14:07,827
Sadie, don't. Someone will hear you.
- Let me go.

1366
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:09,036
Go away.

1367
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:11,627
Oh Handsome, why can't you let me be?

1368
01:14:16,978 --> 01:14:19,351
Don't you see, Sadie.
You ain't yourself.

1369
01:14:19,809 --> 01:14:21,930
I am .. I am myself.

1370
01:14:23,217 --> 01:14:25,007
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1371
01:14:26,607 --> 01:14:28,478
Mr Davidson is a holy man.

1372
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:30,994
He's different from you and me.

1373
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,280
He's made me different.

1374
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:35,980
I've been born all over again, Handsome.

1375
01:14:36,348 --> 01:14:37,407
Can't you see?

1376
01:14:37,955 --> 01:14:39,903
Yes, I see. And I see something else.

1377
01:14:40,929 --> 01:14:43,444
Remember I told you if you ever
needed a friend I'd be here?

1378
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:45,775
Well, you need a friend right now.

1379
01:14:46,311 --> 01:14:48,056
You're not going to San Francisco.

1380
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:49,822
You're going to Sidney.

1381
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:51,262
Sadie.

1382
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,853
Out there you got your
whole life before you.

1383
01:14:54,443 --> 01:14:57,041
We'll go away where this rain
or anything else can't bother us.

1384
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:58,912
Just you and me.

1385
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:00,894
Like Lefty and Maggie.

1386
01:15:01,766 --> 01:15:02,831
Fifty-fifty.

1387
01:15:03,922 --> 01:15:05,456
You'll be Mrs Tim O'Hara.

1388
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:07,658
It's Sidney and us.

1389
01:15:08,228 --> 01:15:10,377
The whole works against
the Penitentiary.

1390
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:13,522
And I'm taking you whether
you want to go or not.      - No.

1391
01:15:13,882 --> 01:15:15,894
No, you mustn't. You mustn't.

1392
01:15:18,057 --> 01:15:20,666
I'm saved I tell you.
You'll send me to hell.

1393
01:15:20,944 --> 01:15:22,912
Mr Davidson .. Mr David ..

1394
01:15:24,376 --> 01:15:26,081
It seems I got here just about in time.

1395
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:29,658
All evening I had a peculiar
feeling you were in danger.

1396
01:15:29,973 --> 01:15:32,147
Sadie, don't pay any attention to him.

1397
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:35,814
I'm sorry for you, O'Hara. What you
are trying to do is a serious offence.

1398
01:15:36,148 --> 01:15:38,116
What you're trying to do
would make a hyena cry.

1399
01:15:38,216 --> 01:15:40,995
You are trying to abduct Sadie Thompson.
You've attempted to defeat the law.

1400
01:15:41,095 --> 01:15:43,338
And it's likely to go hard with you.
- That's my lookout.

1401
01:15:43,737 --> 01:15:46,190
What kind of a man are you anyway?
Picking on this poor kid here?

1402
01:15:46,528 --> 01:15:47,944
Getting her so she's half crazy.

1403
01:15:48,064 --> 01:15:49,623
Saving her so she can back to prison.

1404
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:52,361
You are one choice specimen,
Davidson. I'll say that for you.

1405
01:15:52,744 --> 01:15:54,276
They don't make your kind every day.

1406
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:56,109
You've a headstrong manner, O'Hara.

1407
01:15:56,209 --> 01:15:58,542
You are breaking barracks and
attempting a high-handed crime.

1408
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:00,487
You defy the authority of state and God.

1409
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:03,414
You cannot go on the way you are going
and I shall see to it that you do not.

1410
01:16:03,551 --> 01:16:05,959
Begging you pardon, might I ask
what you're going to do about it?

1411
01:16:06,059 --> 01:16:07,682
Go back to barracks as fast as you can.

1412
01:16:07,782 --> 01:16:09,920
Report here to me tomorrow
after Miss Thompson has gone.

1413
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,199
Ha. Where do you get these ideas anyway?

1414
01:16:12,562 --> 01:16:14,550
If it's good advice you
want to ladle out, keep it.

1415
01:16:14,785 --> 01:16:17,147
On such rare moments as
I think, I think for myself.

1416
01:16:17,392 --> 01:16:19,552
Well, this is not helping your
case. Watch what you say.

1417
01:16:19,768 --> 01:16:22,013
I'm here to watch out that Sadie
don't make any fool breaks.

1418
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:24,575
You got to do some settling with
me before she does any sailing.

1419
01:16:24,675 --> 01:16:25,656
You're wrong.

1420
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,343
I know what I'm doing.

1421
01:16:27,689 --> 01:16:29,279
I'm sorry, but I see clear.

1422
01:16:30,505 --> 01:16:31,546
You see clear?

1423
01:16:31,762 --> 01:16:33,464
Why, he's got you
so it's like you don't.

1424
01:16:33,662 --> 01:16:35,140
I see what you don't.

1425
01:16:36,339 --> 01:16:38,372
What's happened to me
don't happen to everybody.

1426
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:40,351
I was nothing.

1427
01:16:40,904 --> 01:16:41,906
I was nobody.

1428
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:44,013
Now I'm somebody.

1429
01:16:44,486 --> 01:16:45,358
I'm somebody.

1430
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,620
It's a wonderful thing, to know
you've been made of some account.

1431
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:52,142
The only thing I can't see is ..

1432
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:54,058
How it's happened to me.

1433
01:16:55,626 --> 01:16:57,594
Is .. is that the way it is, Sadie?

1434
01:16:59,231 --> 01:16:59,915
Yes.

1435
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:02,886
What do you want me to do?

1436
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:06,821
I don't want you to do anything.

1437
01:17:08,177 --> 01:17:08,963
Except.

1438
01:17:09,982 --> 01:17:11,522
Just don't say anything more.

1439
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:14,518
Alright.

1440
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:17,671
I'll tell the boys to
bring your things back.

1441
01:17:20,252 --> 01:17:20,924
Sadie.

1442
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:25,059
If you and me never
see each other again.

1443
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,311
I want to say this.

1444
01:17:30,294 --> 01:17:31,423
I'll never forget you.

1445
01:17:33,268 --> 01:17:33,920
Ever.

1446
01:17:42,915 --> 01:17:43,873
If you'd like ..

1447
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:48,409
I'll come back tomorrow and put
your things aboard the boat for you.

1448
01:17:50,259 --> 01:17:51,427
If you want me to.

1449
01:18:05,462 --> 01:18:07,165
Don't blame O'Hara, Mr Davidson.

1450
01:18:08,623 --> 01:18:09,695
It was all my fault.

1451
01:18:11,132 --> 01:18:13,365
No my poor child, it was not your fault.

1452
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:18,022
In the last few days you've become
very close and dear to God.

1453
01:18:18,947 --> 01:18:20,925
He has tested you and found you true.

1454
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:24,706
Tonight he sent the devil to tempt
you, but you thrust away the devil.

1455
01:18:26,163 --> 01:18:30,554
Once, your soul lay like a stagnant pool
in the lowest pit of the deepest valley.

1456
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:33,470
But tonight it has lifted to the sun.

1457
01:18:34,578 --> 01:18:37,423
Cleansed, glorified
as the rain of heaven.

1458
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:40,909
When you're here.

1459
01:18:41,778 --> 01:18:42,898
Everything is clear.

1460
01:18:44,072 --> 01:18:45,201
Everything is alright.

1461
01:18:46,171 --> 01:18:47,884
But .. when you are away.

1462
01:18:48,938 --> 01:18:49,814
I'm afraid.

1463
01:18:51,746 --> 01:18:54,312
I get to thinking of
how wicked I used to be.

1464
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:55,941
And.

1465
01:18:56,242 --> 01:18:58,429
I just can't believe it's all forgiven.

1466
01:19:00,572 --> 01:19:01,979
The days aren't so bad but ..

1467
01:19:02,783 --> 01:19:03,803
It's the nights.

1468
01:19:05,316 --> 01:19:07,017
Then I began to think and wonder.

1469
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:09,255
If they are bad now.

1470
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:12,460
What are they going to be like ..

1471
01:19:12,938 --> 01:19:14,411
When you can't come to me anymore?

1472
01:19:14,761 --> 01:19:15,793
When I'm alone?

1473
01:19:15,893 --> 01:19:17,041
When you are alone ..

1474
01:19:17,141 --> 01:19:20,812
My strength will come to you through
prayers which will always be on my lips.

1475
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,080
Little by little, you yourself
will grow stronger .. surer.

1476
01:19:25,395 --> 01:19:28,891
Presently the time will come when
sin and terror will be powerless ..

1477
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:31,916
To penetrate the great love that
God has wrapped around you.

1478
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:34,487
Then will you be redeemed.

1479
01:19:35,485 --> 01:19:38,031
The kingdom and the glory will be yours.

1480
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:40,089
Yes.

1481
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:41,484
Yes.

1482
01:19:42,834 --> 01:19:44,174
When you talk like that.

1483
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:46,363
I'm not afraid.

1484
01:19:47,655 --> 01:19:48,923
That old life I led.

1485
01:19:49,877 --> 01:19:51,207
It don't belong to me at all.

1486
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:53,659
It wasn't me.

1487
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:55,560
It was someone else.

1488
01:19:57,594 --> 01:19:59,764
When I feel like that, Mr Davidson.

1489
01:20:00,623 --> 01:20:02,942
Does it mean I'm redeemed?

1490
01:20:03,249 --> 01:20:04,064
Yes, Sadie.

1491
01:20:05,014 --> 01:20:08,104
Tomorrow will be a very busy day for
you. You will need all your strength.

1492
01:20:09,467 --> 01:20:11,183
You must try and get some sleep now.

1493
01:20:17,264 --> 01:20:19,153
Tomorrow .. but ..

1494
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:21,826
If I wake up tonight.

1495
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:23,478
And get afraid?

1496
01:20:24,097 --> 01:20:25,044
Can I call you?

1497
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:27,027
When I hear you call, I will come.

1498
01:20:29,921 --> 01:20:30,888
I'm very tired.

1499
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,196
Hello Horn. You still up?

1500
01:21:01,504 --> 01:21:02,658
Yep. Reading.

1501
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:05,450
Want anything?
- No. I'm off to bed.

1502
01:21:07,009 --> 01:21:09,978
There is an uncanny concentration
about the rain tonight.

1503
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:13,275
Perhaps. Everybody in?

1504
01:21:13,716 --> 01:21:15,740
Davidson is still out. Can't sleep.

1505
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:17,412
Can't sleep, eh?

1506
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:19,803
He has uneasy dreams, his wife ..

1507
01:21:20,772 --> 01:21:21,680
Tells me.

1508
01:21:24,826 --> 01:21:26,572
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1509
01:21:43,412 --> 01:21:45,974
"<i>Everything goeth,
everything returneth</i>."

1510
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:48,654
"<i>So rolleth the wheel of existence</i>."

1511
01:21:49,937 --> 01:21:51,038
"<i>Everything dieth</i>."

1512
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,241
"<i>Everything blossometh forth again</i>."

1513
01:21:54,191 --> 01:21:56,257
"<i>So runneth the year of existence</i>."

1514
01:22:03,053 --> 01:22:04,972
"<i>Thus spake Zarathustra</i>."

1515
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:21,884
[ Drum beats. Quiet ]

1516
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:27,660
Mr Davidson.

1517
01:22:29,254 --> 01:22:30,951
Oh, Miss Thompson. What are you up for?

1518
01:22:31,852 --> 01:22:32,997
I couldn't sleep.

1519
01:22:34,005 --> 01:22:35,678
This rain and those drums.

1520
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:39,583
And then .. thinking about tomorrow.

1521
01:22:42,403 --> 01:22:45,109
I don't seem to be able to
do much by myself, do I.

1522
01:22:45,302 --> 01:22:48,582
Not yet maybe. But every prayer
is going to make you stronger.

1523
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,571
This time tomorrow, I'll be on the sea.

1524
01:22:56,359 --> 01:22:58,128
I don't suppose we'll ever meet again.

1525
01:22:58,345 --> 01:23:00,415
Not in this life, Sadie. Probably.

1526
01:23:02,262 --> 01:23:03,828
I'll be in prison three years.

1527
01:23:05,483 --> 01:23:06,836
That's a long time.

1528
01:23:08,413 --> 01:23:09,800
What will I do when I come out?

1529
01:23:10,587 --> 01:23:11,640
What will I be?

1530
01:23:13,313 --> 01:23:15,549
For hours and hours I've been wondering.

1531
01:23:16,406 --> 01:23:19,057
Out there in the rain,
I walked and wondered, too.

1532
01:23:19,553 --> 01:23:21,357
The darkness was full of eyes.

1533
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,610
I saw things I never saw before.

1534
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:27,481
I looked into the awful
groves of Astaroth herself.

1535
01:23:29,869 --> 01:23:32,268
Sadie, you don't have to
go back to San Francisco.

1536
01:23:34,025 --> 01:23:35,428
What do you mean?
- Just that.

1537
01:23:37,956 --> 01:23:40,058
Didn't you tell me I had
to make a sacrifice?

1538
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:43,509
Yes, but I repeat. You don't have
to go back unless you truly want to.

1539
01:23:44,661 --> 01:23:45,934
But I do want to.

1540
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:48,687
I haven't got anything else to offer.

1541
01:23:49,018 --> 01:23:52,108
It's the only thing I've got to give.
And I want to give it.

1542
01:23:52,513 --> 01:23:55,070
I thank thee. I thank thee.

1543
01:23:56,377 --> 01:23:58,546
Why do you say that, Mr Davidson?

1544
01:23:58,731 --> 01:24:00,604
Because you said what I knew you'd say.

1545
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,092
My every prayer has been answered.

1546
01:24:04,017 --> 01:24:07,500
I prayed that there might come into
your heart so passionate a desire ..

1547
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,462
For this punishment which you now lay
as an offering at your redeemer's feet.

1548
01:24:11,643 --> 01:24:14,786
That even if I offered to let
you go, you would refuse.

1549

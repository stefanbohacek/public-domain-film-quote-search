1
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,288
But gentlemen...I know nothing
about this article being printed...

2
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:21,672
I was out of town.

3
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:24,422
The let me read what is printed here
in your paper.

4
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:28,333
If Japan wants to control China...

5
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,874
...we must first crush the United States...

6
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:34,827
...just as in the past we had to fight
in the Russo-Japanese War.

7
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:39,127
Gentlemen, you know the Chronicle
has supported the government for 25 years.

8
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,232
Every government.

9
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:45,470
This insult to Baron Tanaka
and the Japanese people...

10
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,203
...has caused great disturbance.

11
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:50,368
You must know the penalty
for disregarding censorship.

12
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:53,525
If my managing editor has violated
any of the regulations...

13
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,169
...I'll fire him!

14
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:57,616
Nick!

15
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,574
Nick Condon!
Somebody dig up Nick Condon!

16
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,683
He's out...something important.

17
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:05,774
Said he wasn't to be disturbed.

18
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:08,101
I don't care if he's interviewing the emperor...

19
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:08,867
Get him here right away!

20
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:17,444
- Get him on the phone, Kinshan.
- OK, Mr Sprague.

21
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:18,802
But he's not going to like it.

22
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:19,834
Get him anyway.

23
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,177
Hello, Oshima!

24
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:42,329
What's on your mind?

25
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,409
There is a matter to discuss...

26
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,705
If you please.

27
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:46,898
Shoot!

28
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:48,699
It is an official matter of great importance.

29
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,387
Great!...Come on in...
We'll talk it over.

30
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:55,606
- Nick...will you please get...
- Oh...alright...alright!

31
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,393
Hand me that towel, will you.

32
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,545
Lies! Lies!
It is all one big lie!

33
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,528
Every word is untrue.

34
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:06,913
Now, just a minute...

35
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:08,862
You must disclose source
of your information.

36
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:10,694
Police must know name
of this traitor.

37
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:12,324
Alright...that's fair enough...

38
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,476
You have a right to know.

39
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:16,971
The name of the traitor
is the American press.

40
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,584
That article appeared
in 3 New York newspapers.

41
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:21,635
But I cannot believe it!

42
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:24,224
Alright...check with your consul
in New York.

43
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,694
Very unfortunate...when an
American newspaper prints slander...

44
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:35,475
Oh, I agree...I agree!

45
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,336
If there's anything I hate...

46
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:40,341
...it's to give anyone a poor impression
of Japanese friendship.

47
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Ah...thank you!

48
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,605
Thank you.

49
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:50,972
You can't do this to me, Nick.

50
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:52,410
My blood pressure won't stand it.

51
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,573
Supposing they shut me down?

52
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,983
When I came here 2 years ago
and took over this rag...

53
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,233
It was on one condition...

54
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,461
And I run it!

55
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,782
I know Nick...but you can't...

56
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:00,991
Your circulation has doubled.

57
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,678
Advertising has gone up 500%...

58
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,569
And you're making more money
than you ever made in your life.

59
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,197
You're not doing so badly yourself.

60
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:07,854
You're making 5 times the money
you made in Shanghai.

61
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,162
Tired of the deal?

62
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,332
Don't think I don't appreciate
what you did for The Chronicle.

63
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,894
But printing things like that...

64
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:14,714
That's what newspapers are for...

65
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:15,984
That's what people buy.

66
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:18,161
Not just Japanese propaganda handouts.

67
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,507
This was just a rumor!

68
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,621
And thousands of American businessmen
have a right to know about rumors like that.

69
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:24,409
I know...I know...but, Nick...

70
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,232
Lots of Japs read English, too.

71
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:29,324
There was more to that
than just a rumor.

72
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,639
When those 2 birds hear about it...

73
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:33,496
I'll have Ollie Miller look into it.

74
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,329
"Look into it"?...
We've got to get out of it!

75
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,909
You're going to write the retraction.

76
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:39,530
I'll write a retraction
when they prove the story is false.

77
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,156
Nick...are you sure that piece
was in the New York papers?

78
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:44,478
The Japs would have caught it on the wires,
and censored it.

79
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,029
New Yorkers read it yesterday.

80
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,863
Yesterday?  Then how
could you have read it?

81
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:51,674
Read it?  I wrote it.

82
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:53,451
Nick!...

83
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,147
Nick...for the love of Mike...

84
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:01,684
Hiya Nick...thought you'd be in jail
by this time.

85
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:04,041
Somebody's going to have to slit your throat
to save his face.

86
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,221
Aren't you a little early with that stuff?

87
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,775
Oh no...it just seems early.

88
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:10,712
I hear the police have collected
all The Chronicles from the newsstands.

89
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:12,376
Well I hope you boys
got YOUR copies.

90
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,869
You're welcome to cable
any part of it you want.

91
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,925
No thanks, I want to stay in Tokyo...
I just signed a new lease.

92
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:19,037
Anybody here seen Ollie...Ollie Miller?

93
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:20,061
No...not yet.

94
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,435
When Ollie Miller's not at this bar...
he must be sick.

95
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:24,857
- See you later.
- Sure.

96
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,423
Oh, there you are, Nick...

97
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,669
Meet Joe Cassell...
He just pulled in from Shanghai.

98
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,970
- Hello...
- Glad to know you.

99
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,891
You gonna sit down?

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,784
- Have a drink?
- Scotch and soda

101
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:49,883
3 Scotch and sodas.

102
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:53,619
Joe Cassell...Joe Cassell...?

103
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,386
Covered the criminal courts
for the old "Tele" of New York...

104
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,531
Then went to Russia, then Peking...

105
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:03,970
Then I lost track.

106
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,452
There's fame for you, Cas!

107
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:06,557
No...that's a good memory.

108
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:07,970
Want a job?

109
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,307
Going home.

110
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:11,872
I was at the Foreign Office this morning...

111
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,122
That story of yours had them
buzzing like hornets.

112
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,456
It was very rizzy.

113
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:16,463
Yeah...Breaks the monotony.

114
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:17,704
Where'd you did it up?

115
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:18,925
A little here...a little there.

116
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,169
Of course, there's not a grain of truth in it...
You know that.

117
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,383
I don't know anything, do YOU?

118
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:25,605
Quite a bit.

119
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:28,539
Our Chinese cousins are trying desperately
to shape public opinion...

120
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:29,772
Against Japan.

121
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:31,767
What for?

122
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,699
To take intention off
their own internal disorder.

123
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,970
Believe me...
"disorder" is a clean name for it.

124
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,953
I've just spent 4 years there...
I know.

125
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,735
I lived there 6 years, myself.

126
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:41,960
4 was enough for me...

127
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,588
Not that I haven't a tremendous admiration
for the Chinese people.

128
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:46,981
I see...

129
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,383
"Some of my best friends are Chinese"...eh?!

130
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,542
Well!...At last!

131
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:03,707
Hiya fellas...Hiya Begana!

132
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,960
Hey Jack...did you get a load of that
front page of Nick's, this morning...

133
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,487
Dynamite!...eh?

134
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:11,152
Hey...how about a little drink...
Set 'em up...on me!

135
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,307
YOU buying?!

136
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,183
As many as you can handle.

137
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:17,623
-I'll have a double Scotch.
- Bourbon, double.

138
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,033
How about you, Begana?

139
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:19,989
I'll have a little soda.

140
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,157
You know what I want.

141
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:23,708
But Mr Condon...
China, throughout the centuries...

142
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,920
Excuse please...Mr Miller is here.

143
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:32,049
Yessir!...I'm quittin'!

144
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,303
What? Again?

145
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:35,030
Ever see these things before?

146
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:37,089
Keep the change!

147
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,180
2 tickets for home on the first boat I could get...
Leaving tonight.

148
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,070
Where did you get the dough?

149
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,201
New invention.

150
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,742
Secret machines...press buttons...

151
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:50,081
Out comes fives...tens...hundreds!

152
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:53,453
Well in that case,
how about the 2 you owe me?

153
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,781
A pleasure...a pleasure!

154
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,770
And here's the 10
that you wouldn't loan me, stinker!

155
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,733
Buy a round of drinks.

156
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,620
Excuse me,
we'll continue this...

157
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,168
Ollie just came in...
I'll see you later.

158
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:05,095
So long, Nick.

159
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,614
Yessir, I'm quittin' this godforsaken land...
What has it got?

160
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:13,407
Cherry blossoms...but no cherries.

161
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,074
What kinda cherry trees
are those?

162
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:19,710
I'll probably settle down in Connecticut...
and write a book.

163
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,229
Yes, we'll all write a book, though.

164
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,797
Hiya Nick boy...!

165
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,454
A fine little welcome for you all over...
200!

166
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:31,975
...and 20...a debt of long standing.

167
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:34,053
Great honor to pay!

168
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,956
You must have been trading
in Shanghai silver!

169
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,738
Johnson's just gonna buy us a drink!

170
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,952
Where'd you get the money?

171
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,620
I came into it.

172
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,390
Come on....make sense...
What's up?

173
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:00,343
I may well take offense
at the scepticism of your tone.

174
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:04,369
But I prefer to be generous
and remember you as my friend...

175
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:05,881
...and former employer.

176
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:09,949
That I attribute to your bitter jealousy
of my good fortune.

177
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:12,467
FORMER employer?

178
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,453
I'm leaving...tonight.

179
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:16,894
Me and Edith...on the "Nagata Maru".

180
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:20,576
Where did you get that money?

181
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,169
Nick...take a tip from me...

182
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,277
Come back to the States.

183
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,097
This place is getting hotter
than the inside of Fujiyama...

184
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:30,090
Get out!...There was blood
on the street this morning.

185
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,141
It'll be flowing like a river,
before the summer's over.

186
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:34,361
You are mixed up
with something shady.

187
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:38,098
Me?...Ollie Miller?!

188
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:43,112
And don't forget...Edith...Cabin 23...

189
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:44,881
Come down tonight
and I'll fill you full of champagne...

190
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,274
..and tell you how much I love you!

191
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:50,510
"Man's best friend"...you dog!

192
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:55,791
Friends...nice people...so long!

193
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:43,888
Nick...isn't it marvellous...?
Going home!

194
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:45,429
I won't believe it 'til I'm seasick!

195
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,530
Great stuff!

196
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,163
You go on with your packing, Edy.

197
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:53,710
Yeah...I have to.

198
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,326
Never been early in my life.

199
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:56,778
What's it all about?

200
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,203
Oh Nick, you've got me...
All of a sudden everything's wonderful.

201
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:00,400
Really terrific!

202
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,508
And did Ollie explain it?

203
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,530
Oh, like he does everything else...
He dismisses it.

204
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,924
Didn't he say anything?

205
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:07,933
Oh, vague...very vague.

206
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:10,239
Something about a contract
for a book he's going to write.

207
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,602
Big literary deal...advance royalties...
scads of money!

208
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,701
Fine...fine!

209
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,975
Nick...I don't care where he got it.

210
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,280
Maybe he stole the emperor's treasures...

211
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,881
All I know is, we're going home.

212
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,967
This place is slowly killing him.

213
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:33,037
Me too.

214
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,360
Alright...after all Ollie's private business
is still his own.

215
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,336
But I didn't want to see either of you
getting into a jam...

216
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,766
...because of anything...irregular.

217
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:44,090
If there was anybody he'd tell
what it was all about, it'd be you, Nick!

218
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:46,374
That's what has me worried...
He hasn't!

219
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:49,433
You'll be at the boat, tonight?

220
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:53,214
Sure...with a couple of magnums
of champagne.

221
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:54,984
That should open his big mouth!

222
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:56,872
He's opened it on less.

223
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:01,112
Nick...in case I don't get a chance
to tell you tonight...

224
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,663
You're all we going to miss
in this place.

225
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:07,352
I wish you were coming back
with us.

226
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,224
See you at the boat, beautiful!

227
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,194
Good evening Condon San...
You going to America?

228
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:49,006
Oh no...you're too anxious
to get rid of me...

229
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:50,781
Just going to see a couple of friends of mine
up on the boat.

230
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,130
Your name, please.

231
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,245
Ask Hijakata here...
He's been tailing me all day.

232
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:00,452
I am thought-control officer.
Please answer questions.

233
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,608
Alright...I'll give you an answer...

234
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:07,358
I'm thinking this is a new low in stupidity...
even for the Imperial Police.

235
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:09,558
Now I want to see Mr and Mrs Miller
in stateroom 23...

236
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:11,521
Any objections?

237
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:16,318
Not yet...Mr and Mrs Miller
not yet arrived.

238
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:17,396
Well, I'll wait for them on deck.

239
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,731
Sorry! Not permitted tonight.

240
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,035
"Armstrong"...Come on, dear.

241
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,542
Edy!

242
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:40,740
Too bad...you refused to believe police.

243
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:48,229
Now you know...truth has been told...

244
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:50,845
You thought for yourself...
"Friends have not yet arrived."

245
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,853
Hello...Tokyo Chronicle, please!

246
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:06,803
Charlie Sprague.

247
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:11,121
Chronicle office.

248
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:14,052
Charlie...there's trouble...big trouble.

249
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,472
I can't tell you about it now..
I'm coming right down.

250
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,540
Find out where the ambassador is...

251
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,128
...and get a call through to him
right away.

252
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:21,056
Right, Nick.

253
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:22,674
Did Ollie Miller reach you?

254
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:25,529
He's been trying
to get in touch with you...

255
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:26,313
Said it was urgent.

256
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,260
Where is he?

257
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,371
He said he'd try to get over
to your home.

258
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:32,597
Fine. Well I'll go there, then...
Switch the call there.

259
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,124
Ollie!

260
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,356
Take a sip of this.

261
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:27,887
There you are.

262
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,364
Ollie...can you tell me
what happened?

263
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:42,640
I didn't know it was
going to be so tough...

264
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,351
I'd have asked for more money...

265
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,115
You made a good guess
in the paper this morning.

266
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,199
You won't have to guess any more, Nick.

267
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:02,151
Tanaka planned it.

268
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:13,865
I'm glad Edith got away OK.

269
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,870
Sorry I missed the boat.

270
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,734
Ollie!

271
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,622
What is it?

272
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,148
Very sorry to disturb.

273
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,232
So am I...Beat it!

274
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,726
A desperate criminal escaped police...

275
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:20,205
Maybe he is hiding here.

276
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,902
Sorry...we must search.

277
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:23,343
It is to protect you.

278
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,191
There's nobody here and I don't need
anybody to protect me...

279
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:26,202
Now get out!

280
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:27,157
Have accident?

281
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:35,762
Here is criminal!

282
00:22:35,762 --> 00:22:37,458
Don't you mean "victim"?

283
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:44,754
We must search house, please.

284
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,181
Of course, there was nothing to find...
now get out of here.

285
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:19,384
Yes...but you come with us...
make report.

286
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,186
Alright...

287
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:25,086
That's exactly what I ought to do.

288
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:27,840
If you just give me a chance
to phone my office...

289
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,030
Not permitting telephone.

290
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,976
Now look here, Oshima...
I'm getting awfully tired of this.

291
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:36,487
You're chief, Yamada,
is a very good friend of mine...

292
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:37,460
I don't want to have to turn you in.

293
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,387
Come, please.

294
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:40,616
Alright.

295
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:24,946
Condon San...

296
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,441
Good morning, Condon San!

297
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:51,883
Did not expect you here...
except as friend.

298
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,461
May I use your phone?

299
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:58,592
Tokyo Chronicle, please.

300
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:01,823
You've got some explaining to do,
Yamada!

301
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:05,008
Get me Charlie Sprague!

302
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,991
Among other things, my government
doesn't like its nationals...

303
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:10,864
...to be thrown into the jug,
without any charge.

304
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:14,996
Japanese government would not do that
to American, Condon San.

305
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:17,317
Here is charge.

306
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:22,628
Nicholas Condon, Managing Editor
Tokyo Chronicle...

307
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:26,076
...held private celebration
in his own home...

308
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:29,037
...gaiety intense, and far-reaching...

309
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:31,691
...causing complaints from neighbors...

310
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:34,249
Complaints ignored...

311
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:38,171
...forcing police to make polite request
that gaiety subdue.

312
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,347
Request ignored.

313
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:44,830
Police enter home at 10.30pm.

314
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,393
Find Nicholas Condon with 2 girls.

315
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:51,273
Two...Condon San?!

316
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,729
Condon very much under influence
of saké.

317
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:00,120
Demand police leave.

318
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Police demand 2 girls leave.

319
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,575
Condon attempt
to throw police out.

320
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:08,652
Condon overcome by drink.

321
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:13,006
Friendly police put him to bed
in city jail...to protect him.

322
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,789
You've cut me off...
Get me the Tokyo Chronicle again, please.

323
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,801
Because holding you in much esteem...

324
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:24,412
Man of great prestige...

325
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:27,387
No longer angry with protective police...

326
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:29,252
You are free to go.

327
00:26:30,077 --> 00:26:31,007
Thanks.

328
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:31,617
Charlie!

329
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:35,602
Nick, please...go home
and get a little sleep.

330
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:39,214
You had us up all last night...
We even woke the ambassador.

331
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:41,356
I don't know how
we're gonna alibi it to him.

332
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:43,446
Japanese papers are full of what you did.

333
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:44,737
Never mind that...

334
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,155
I'm glad you got the ambassador...

335
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:48,006
Get him again and tell him I got to see him
as soon as possible.

336
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,904
And get in your car and pick me up here.

337
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:52,981
Bring a camera!

338
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,912
Sgt Oshima...you know our good friend
Conon San of Tokyo Chronicle?

339
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:01,403
We have met many times.

340
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:02,902
- It's a great honor.
- It's not mutual.

341
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:05,634
You killed 2 Americans last night, Oshima...

342
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,631
One on the "Nagata Maru"
and the other at my house.

343
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:10,762
Serious charge, Condon San.

344
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,084
Your have proof?

345
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:16,548
Condon San and saké
have big fight last night.

346
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:18,312
Saké win!

347
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:21,086
I suppose you weren't at the harbor...

348
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,137
...and you weren't at my house?

349
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:26,551
Last night we take families
to view cherry blossoms in moonlight.

350
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:29,465
Most pleasurable evening.

351
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:33,587
Better you forget bad dreams
and go home to good sleep.

352
00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:36,312
Sayonara, Condon San.

353
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,295
Anytime I make big joke I say...

354
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:41,821
Hope I am not too serious...too soon.

355
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,546
Understand...you very strong judo.

356
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:50,742
Perhaps you honor me
with contest some time.

357
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:56,931
Certainly...only I hope next time
it'll be face to face!

358
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:21,672
You can put your camera away...

359
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:23,862
There's the window
Ollie plowed through last night...

360
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,409
They've replaced it.

361
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:27,848
Replaced number one...
even to the lipstick.

362
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:29,615
Replaced...number two...

363
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:30,810
They don't miss a bit.

364
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:38,651
They'd even take out the bloodstains.

365
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,223
They are very thorough.

366
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:48,085
What is it, Nick?

367
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:51,871
There's someone at the door...
Shall I see who it is?

368
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:53,359
Yeah...see who it is.

369
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:08,903
- Mr Condon please...
- Come in.

370
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,437
This is Mr Condon.

371
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,749
Haynoshi.

372
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:21,767
Thank you...am from Foreign Office.

373
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:24,104
Please permit me to escort you
to audience...

374
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:27,760
...with his Excellency
Premier General Baron Tanaka.

375
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:33,923
Well...I'm going to be busy
for a couple of hours...

376
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:36,370
Tell him I'll drop into his office
sometime this afternoon.

377
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,399
Please...not to office...

378
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,108
His Excellency awaits you
at his home.

379
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:43,034
Home?!

380
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,489
An honor!

381
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:53,585
A few minutes, please.

382
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:16,826
Won't you join us?

383
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:20,949
Not now, thank you, Prince Tatsugi...
if you don't mind.

384
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:24,113
I'm afraid Iris is unhappy these days...

385
00:30:25,062 --> 00:30:29,820
Unfortunately it was necessary to involve her
in this distasteful affair.

386
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,561
Colonel Tojo advised it.

387
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:39,660
Since when, Baron Tanaka, do you concede
to Colonel Tojo's sordid wishes?

388
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:42,587
I did not concede, Prince Tatsugi...

389
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:44,405
I agreed.

390
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:47,877
In the future, I would be less unhappy
if I were not called upon...

391
00:30:47,877 --> 00:30:50,970
...to search the effects of a woman
so horribly murdered.

392
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,618
It will not happen again, my dear.

393
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:55,383
I promise that.

394
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:03,975
An interesting woman!

395
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:05,774
Yes.

396
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:07,756
Mixed parentage?

397
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:09,241
Yes...

398
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:11,810
- Her mother was...
- Chinese.

399
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:19,922
Baron...you know that I have communicated
my fears to the emperor...

400
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:23,819
...regarding the road on which
you are determined to lead the nation.

401
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:28,112
Your Highness...the decisions
already have been submitted to the emperor.

402
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:33,282
Your great influence, Baron,
could still check the militarists.

403
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:38,281
I am but an old man whose voice
no longer carries its authority.

404
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:44,931
But you are among the most highly-esteemed
in my cabinet...Your Highness.

405
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:49,737
Esteemed...esteemed as a liberal screen.

406
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:54,664
I'm the scroll of the poet, behind which
samurai swords are being sharpened.

407
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:58,893
Without armed strength,
we will perish.

408
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:00,244
That is my view.

409
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:03,324
Those views will lead, in time, to disaster.

410
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:05,890
We see the problem differently.

411
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,510
That is true.

412
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,323
To uphold my beliefs,
I would die with honor.

413
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:15,918
You, Baron Tanaka, will die
only to erase your dishonor.

414
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,919
Mr Hyashi and Mr Condon.

415
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:49,074
It is a pleasure to see you again, Mr Condon.

416
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:52,357
Colonel Tojo, of the Imperial Army...

417
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:57,531
And you know Major Kudyoka,
Imperial Secret Police.

418
00:32:59,317 --> 00:33:00,721
And Mr Nicholas Condon.

419
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:01,738
But please sit down.

420
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:06,704
Thank you for coming to my home.

421
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:09,297
It is more agreeable
than meeting at the office.

422
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:13,990
Here we are not bothered
with...newspapermen!

423
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:23,980
Your front-page story yesterday, Mr Condon,
was somewhat...embarrassing.

424
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,290
Can't please everybody.

425
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:29,311
Of course.

426
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:34,288
We realise you had no way of knowing
it was an inopportune moment for such a story.

427
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:39,886
Frankly Mr Condon, certain liberal
subversive factions within our own country...

428
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:43,666
...are seeking to create an incident
to weaken the present government.

429
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:47,760
They are responsible for the malicious rumor
which you have regrettably printed.

430
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:54,783
As I said, Mr Condon, the story itself
is unimportant...

431
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,277
There rumors of a document
which plans world conquest...

432
00:33:58,277 --> 00:33:59,340
...are ridiculous.

433
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:03,996
But...should this rumor be taken seriously
by the wrong people...

434
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:09,685
A blazing fire might be kindled...
which Japan would find costly to extinguish.

435
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:12,682
Oh, I see...what you are saying is...

436
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:15,372
You'd like the Chronicle to put on
a "Fire Prevention Week" campaign.

437
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:16,241
Is that it?

438
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,204
No, Mr Condon.

439
00:34:17,204 --> 00:34:22,378
Within the past 24 hours, we've discovered a plot
to smuggle this forged document out of Japan.

440
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:25,724
A man by the name of Oliver Miller...
one of your former employees...

441
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:26,477
..is involved.

442
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:29,943
We could recover the document
from him by force...

443
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,339
...if we chose.

444
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:36,779
We would prefer that you persuade him
to return it to us.

445
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:40,541
It seems you haven't heard,
Your Excellency...

446
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:44,887
...nor your secret police, Major...
that Mr and Mrs Miller were murdered.

447
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:46,021
Last night.

448
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:54,597
We read in the papers this morning
about your escapade last night, Mr Condon.

449
00:34:55,822 --> 00:35:01,253
In your incoherent condition,
you spoke of this unpleasant fantasy.

450
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,557
As we were concerned with the fate of Mr Miller,
even more than you...

451
00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:07,939
...we immediately made inquiries.

452
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,939
From the captain of the "Nagata Maru"...

453
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:13,516
A most trustworthy gentleman.

454
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:22,649
Isn't it clear to you now?

455
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,304
Perfectly clear.

456
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:31,650
In every detail, Mr Condon, murder
is an ugly and dishonerable act...

457
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,354
And to prove it, some one
must be accused...

458
00:35:33,354 --> 00:35:34,976
Bodies must be produced.

459
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:39,351
Now, Mr Condon...to approach this problem
that way...

460
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:41,936
...would only lead
to many difficulties.

461
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,548
If you send Mr Miller a radiogram...

462
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:49,633
...I am sure he will return
the document to us...

463
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:51,646
...through you.

464
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:56,370
Everyone would be enormously relieved.

465
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,254
And you would greatly profit.

466
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:05,030
We will all get to laugh at the strange
hallucination which you experienced last night.

467
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:07,942
I see...

468
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:11,260
You want this "forgery" returned.

469
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,345
Yes.

470
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:15,052
And you're willing to pay plenty for it.

471
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:22,074
Alright...here's my price...

472
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:29,177
When the United States embassy
is informed...

473
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:31,635
that the murderers
of Ollie Miller and his wife

474
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:34,458
I mean the real murderers...
Oshima and Izikata...

475
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,276
...Not a couple of sacrificial monkeys...

476
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:38,845
...are brought to trial
and convicted.

477
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:40,128
Then, and only then...

478
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:43,016
...the thing that you're looking for
may turn up.

479
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:57,127
Alright...sit down...drink?

480
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,381
Whisky.

481
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:03,812
For the love of Mike...
What's this about you quitting the paper?

482
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:06,516
Trying to give you a break...
You want my job, don't you?

483
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,278
Come on...don't toy with me...
What's up? What happened with Tanaka?

484
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,215
Charlie...I can't tell you much...

485
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:12,886
You'll have to be satisfied
with the crumbs.

486
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:15,847
After I left Tanaka,
I went to the embassy...

487
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,257
We had a long talk.

488
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:18,586
Now don't ask any questions.

489
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:20,526
This much I can tell you...

490
00:37:20,526 --> 00:37:22,512
They're sending me
back to Washington.

491
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:26,654
OK...crumbs...but from cake!

492
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:30,557
I suppose you saw "Bright Eyes" over there?

493
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,809
He's been tailing me all day.

494
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:38,803
They know you're leaving...
they might have other plans for you...

495
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,376
...Ollie-Miller-style.

496
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:44,726
Polite...but official.

497
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:47,772
Oh yeah...and one more for me.

498
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:51,113
After you finish that drink,
you're going back to the office.

499
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:55,025
I want a story in tomorrow's paper that says
I'm sailing in 10 days on the "President Wilson".

500
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,115
Why the publicity?

501
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:01,916
If my  hunch is right, Charlie...
the police did not get that document.

502
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:04,826
So it must've been the people
that want to get it out of Japan.

503
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,480
Now, if they know I'm sailing...
they may try to get in touch with me.

504
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,630
Don't do it Nick...keep on ice
until the boat sails.

505
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,033
There's a one-column cut of me in the files...
three-quarter face...very flattering...

506
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:17,168
Run that with the story...
front page.

507
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,631
Hey kiddy...do me a favor, will you...

508
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,210
Keep an eye on my friend over there.

509
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,859
I say, Condon...
may we join you?

510
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,776
It looks as if every table's taken.

511
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:55,277
I arranged it that way.

512
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:57,743
This is Nick Condon, "Tokyo Chronicle"...

513
00:38:57,743 --> 00:38:59,812
Miss Iris Hilliard,
just arrived from Shanghai.

514
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:02,110
I hope you'll enjoy Tokyo.

515
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,680
I think I'm going to.

516
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:05,545
Never mind...I do it better...

517
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:07,605
And besides...I'm not crazy.

518
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:09,731
What do you mean..."crazy"?

519
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:14,165
No man in his right mind would willingly
share your company, Miss Hilliard.

520
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:16,568
How's Shanghai these days?

521
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:18,056
Oh, Shanghai's always gay.

522
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,141
For everyone but the Chinese.

523
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,396
May the waiter interrupt long enough
to take your orders?

524
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,973
- Daiquiri.
- The same.

525
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:29,709
How was the trip over?

526
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,005
A little on the rough side.

527
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,992
I always say it's not the ocean,
but the Japanese boats.

528
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:37,530
You arrived last night?

529
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:39,036
Yes.

530
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:47,475
I went down to see a couple of friends off
on the "Nagata Maru" last night...

531
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:51,231
You didn't by any chance come in
on that boat, did you?

532
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:55,290
Look here, Condon...

533
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,083
...you have a reputation
for bad manners...

534
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,608
...but this is going too far!

535
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:02,424
It's alright, Mr Cassell....
perhaps Mr Condon can explain.

536
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,336
Telephone, Mr Cassell.

537
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:06,384
Excuse me.

538
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:10,930
Well?

539
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,080
I'm sorry.

540
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:17,672
I had kind of a rough night, last night...

541
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:20,622
I'm not quite myself today.

542
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:22,836
I read about it in this morning's paper.

543
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:26,149
Oh, that story?...
Not true.

544
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,151
I didn't think so.

545
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:29,615
Too much fun to be true.

546
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,798
May I have a cigarette?

547
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:36,661
I'd like to make a confession.

548
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,870
Well, we're alone.

549
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,872
You were right about Cassell.

550
00:40:42,872 --> 00:40:44,482
He is crazy.

551
00:40:44,482 --> 00:40:47,251
I insisted on coming over here.

552
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:48,108
Why?

553
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,383
I wanted to meet you.

554
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:54,483
You certainly know your judo, don't you?

555
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:57,033
You've had me off-balance 
ever since you came in.

556
00:40:57,606 --> 00:40:58,484
Good!

557
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:02,765
What you're saying is that...

558
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:04,441
...you're making a play for me.

559
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:05,367
Why?

560
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:08,625
Perhaps I like your looks.

561
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,803
No...not with this!

562
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,167
There are maybe things, 
about that, I like.

563
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,509
What?

564
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,285
I've always liked red hair.

565
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:21,558
I grew it for you.

566
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:22,925
And the ears.

567
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:25,009
Two of those.

568
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:26,829
Isn't that good?

569
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:28,545
More would be vulgar.

570
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,008
Keep on! Keep on!

571
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,309
Pretty soon we'll level.

572
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,116
Alright Mr Condon...

573
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:39,926
Let's...to use your phrase...level.

574
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:43,736
I was told to meet you, by a friend.

575
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:45,895
Yes...but whose friend?

576
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:48,144
Yours...in Shanghai.

577
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:52,268
A very wonderful, 
almost saintly old man.

578
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:55,767
Chang Po Ling!

579
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:57,790
Yes.

580
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,105
Yes...wonderful!

581
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:02,090
And he asked you 
to look me up?

582
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:03,819
Yes.

583
00:42:04,706 --> 00:42:06,450
He certainly hasn't forgotten me.

584
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:09,073
No...he remembers you very well...

585
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:10,305
As you were then.

586
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:12,638
He hoped you hadn't changed.

587
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,328
Just what does that mean?

588
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:22,157
First...we'll become better acquainted.

589
00:42:22,157 --> 00:42:24,105
It was his desire.

590
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:26,502
His desire became mine...
5 minutes ago.

591
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:28,935
Come on, let's figure a way 
to go about that.

592
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:30,464
About what?

593
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,582
How to get better acquainted 
in the shortest possible time.

594
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:34,700
You see, I'm leaving in 10 days.

595
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:37,723
Oh, that's not bad...
Come on let's drink to them.

596
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:40,186
- To "them"?
- Yeah...10 days.

597
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:42,514
"The 10 days that shook the world."

598
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:07,135
Iris...my dear!

599
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:09,630
Do you know Colonel Tojo?

600
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,548
Of course.

601
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:13,044
And Major Kazyoka?

602
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,740
- Tea?
- No thank you.

603
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:22,039
Have you anything to report?

604
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:26,232
I have made SOME progress.

605
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:27,911
What progress, please?

606
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,309
Mr Condon find me attractive.

607
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,472
The introduction I arranged 
worked smoothly?

608
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:37,375
Excellently, thank you.

609
00:43:43,215 --> 00:43:47,495
This adventure, Colonel Tojo, has many ramifications 
which I find displeasing.

610
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:53,484
Perhaps we can eliminate the sordid details,
and learn exactly what has occurred, thus far.

611
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,808
Does this man possess the document?

612
00:43:57,808 --> 00:43:59,719
I cannot say for certain.

613
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:01,817
I'm sure he does, Your Excellency...

614
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:03,469
It would appear so.

615
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:07,618
It is Mr Condon's ambition to leave Tokyo, 
in good health, within one week.

616
00:44:07,618 --> 00:44:10,526
He is relying upon his embassy 
to protect him.

617
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:12,178
That means you must work swiftly.

618
00:44:12,178 --> 00:44:16,481
Colonel Tojo...I do not need YOU, 
to remind me of my duty.

619
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:21,013
As far as Mr Condon is concerned, 
I have every hope for success.

620
00:44:21,013 --> 00:44:23,501
Hope alone will not suffice.

621
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:53,708
Hey, Charlie...that fellow with the top-hat 
just going out...

622
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,784
Isn't he the one from the Foreign Office, 
who was over at my house the other day?

623
00:44:56,784 --> 00:44:58,136
Hayoshi?

624
00:44:58,136 --> 00:45:00,277
Yeah...why?

625
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:02,244
Oh...nothing...

626
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:04,028
Just checking...thanks.

627
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:16,584
Do you know a guy named Cassell?

628
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:18,786
A Joe Cassell?

629
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,586
Yeah...heard of him.

630
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,071
Well I just got a wire 
from the States about him...

631
00:45:25,071 --> 00:45:26,181
They say he's a good man.

632
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,322
I thought I'd try him out in YOUR
job after you go.

633
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:30,259
From what "States"?

634
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:33,520
You mean you just got an order 
from the japanese Foreign Office to put him on!

635
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,078
2 minutes ago.

636
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:36,912
That's an insult!
Nobody dictates to ME!

637
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:38,647
No...not even your own conscience.

638
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:40,827
You promised Charlie Sprague my job, 
didn't you?

639
00:45:40,827 --> 00:45:41,916
Well, I reconsidered...

640
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,192
They say Joe Cassell has got 
a fine record in journalism.

641
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:47,567
Yeah...great...he ran a paper in China 
that posed as "the friend of the people"...

642
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:50,185
And on the side, he set up 
a patriotic organization... 

643
00:45:50,185 --> 00:45:53,161
...that collected nickels and dimes 
from the poor Chinese in the States...

644
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:55,442
...to print anti-Japanese propaganda.

645
00:45:55,442 --> 00:45:56,908
What of it?

646
00:45:56,908 --> 00:45:59,109
Nothing much...but instead of 
printing the leaflets...

647
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:00,988
...he lost the money in the stock market.

648
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:03,189
60,000 bucks!

649
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:06,981
His partner committed suicide...
and Cassell decided on a change of climate.

650
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,560
I don't suppose 
you can prove that?

651
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,007
Alright...if that isn't enough...

652
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:12,732
I'll dig up something that'll make 
even YOUR stomach crawl.

653
00:46:12,732 --> 00:46:14,108
But if you've got any sense...

654
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,410
You'll stick to Charlie Sprague.

655
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,376
Will you stop trying to run my paper!

656
00:46:17,376 --> 00:46:19,895
Yes...right now!

657
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:24,199
OK...OK...I'll give it some more thought.

658
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,773
Hey, Nick...where are you going?

659
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:37,518
What do the Japanese say?...

660
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:40,013
"If the flower is to be beautiful...
it must be cultivated."

661
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:09,775
Come on...

662
00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:36,233
Do you know what this chase 
has done for me?...

663
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:37,852
...Developed a ravenous appetite!

664
00:47:39,105 --> 00:47:40,809
I've developed a few, myself.

665
00:47:41,656 --> 00:47:44,545
- Must we really avoid him?
- No... Come on.

666
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:05,985
Thanks kiddy!

667
00:48:08,414 --> 00:48:09,671
We are about to dine at Sato's.

668
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:11,822
Excellent restaurant.

669
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,051
We thought you'd like it.

670
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:15,363
Nothing too good for 
the Imperial Secret Police!

671
00:48:15,363 --> 00:48:16,766
Thank you.

672
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:42,230
You like it, eh?

673
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,951
Japan is lovely.

674
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:46,173
What I've seen of it in 3 days.

675
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,448
The scenery is alright...
but some of the inhabitants I object to.

676
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,809
The higher up you go, 
the lower-grade people you meet.

677
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:53,839
But I'm lucky...

678
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,364
...that I don't have to meet 
any highly-placed Japanese in my work.

679
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:00,393
- Work?
- Of course.

680
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:02,593
Namely?

681
00:49:03,536 --> 00:49:06,455
I'm studying the problems 
of Japanese women.

682
00:49:07,874 --> 00:49:08,851
Why?

683
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:12,168
For a friend in Shanghai.

684
00:49:13,608 --> 00:49:16,208
Now don't tell me that's why he told you 
to get in touch with me.

685
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:21,569
Nick...you know so much...
and still you're so ignorant about women.

686
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:25,520
Ignorant...but awfully willing.

687
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:29,582
Do you know anything at all 
about Japanese women?

688
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,916
Now, what kind of a question is that?

689
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,929
Academic or personal?

690
00:49:36,448 --> 00:49:38,078
You won't be serious!

691
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:39,409
Oh, I'll be serious.

692
00:49:41,964 --> 00:49:43,782
They're not considered human beings.

693
00:49:43,782 --> 00:49:45,532
They're not even allowed to think.

694
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:46,849
It's against the law.

695
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,703
I imagine they "bootleg" a thought 
now and then.

696
00:49:51,308 --> 00:49:54,142
Yes..."bootleg" thinking...
that's not good enough.

697
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:57,234
And so...you've elected to help them.

698
00:49:58,327 --> 00:49:58,952
Why not?

699
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,479
I'm a woman.

700
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:06,523
I've been aware of that 
for some time.

701
00:50:10,693 --> 00:50:13,564
The Chinese women 
are just beginning to learn...

702
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:14,917
...what it could mean to be free.

703
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:17,949
If the Japanese women felt the same way...

704
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:22,470
You mean that might stop...Tanaka...
...Tojo...Yamoto, and all the rest?

705
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:25,250
It might help.

706
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:30,858
This Tanaka plan...
What do you know about it?

707
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:34,603
Why don't you tell ME?

708
00:50:34,603 --> 00:50:38,085
I haven't published any articles 
on the subject.

709
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:48,831
Why don't I just kill him off?

710
00:50:51,756 --> 00:50:54,168
I think I know a less violent solution.

711
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:01,768
Wait a minute...

712
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:04,418
Watch!

713
00:51:16,689 --> 00:51:18,503
Don't wait up for me, kiddy!

714
00:51:26,513 --> 00:51:27,880
- Do you mind?
- No...

715
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,208
Very nice!

716
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:54,577
Somebody been expecting us?

717
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,083
Help yourself.

718
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:58,951
- You?  - Please.

719
00:51:58,951 --> 00:52:01,572
How about one 
for Hijakata out there?

720
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:03,802
Let him suffer.

721
00:52:16,048 --> 00:52:16,934
You've got a pretty good notion there.

722
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,047
Do you understand Chinese?

723
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:32,707
I'm afraid she's hopelessly romantic.

724
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:35,131
She's not exactly my type, but...

725
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:38,711
On the other hand...with a few alterations...
you'd be...

726
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:41,000
What sort of alterations?

727
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,991
This is just kind of a game...

728
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:43,990
Rule 1...

729
00:52:44,968 --> 00:52:48,346
Learn never to interrupt a conversation
when it begins to get interesting.

730
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:49,483
Rule 2...

731
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:54,181
Whenever you sit, always sit 
with your chin tilted up like this...

732
00:52:55,966 --> 00:52:56,642
Like this?

733
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,024
Perfect.

734
00:53:00,024 --> 00:53:01,836
When did you leave China, Nick?

735
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:04,305
There goes Rule 1!

736
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,043
I left China 2 years ago...

737
00:53:08,043 --> 00:53:10,579
Left Brooklyn 15 years ago...

738
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:12,339
Cleveland 10 years ago...

739
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:14,986
Kansas City in the summer of 1921.

740
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:17,753
Now would you like me to go all 
through the towns very quickly...

741
00:53:17,753 --> 00:53:18,988
...Just sort of get them
out of the way?

742
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,105
I don't think that'll be necessary.

743
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:22,904
Well I just wanted to make sure 
I'd cover everything... 

744
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:23,972
...that you might interrupt with.

745
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:27,733
I'm afraid I'll have to interrupt you, Nick.

746
00:53:34,204 --> 00:53:35,469
Why?

747
00:53:36,939 --> 00:53:38,208
I was just thinking...

748
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:41,692
You were thinking of 
changing the subject again!

749
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,986
Now...let me tell  you what I'M thinking...

750
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:48,624
I think I know.

751
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:50,851
And I like it very much.

752
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:55,302
But I don't believe you really know 
what you think of me.

753
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:57,809
Maybe I do.

754
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:01,001
Desirable woman?

755
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:03,942
Much more than that.

756
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,068
Be sensible, Nick...
What I'm trying to tell you...

757
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:12,249
That I'm half Chinese...

758
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,014
I'm half Irish and half Norwegian!

759
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:16,316
It isn't the same thing.

760
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,274
What are you trying to do...
run down the Irish?

761
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:24,555
Thank you, Nick.

762
00:54:24,555 --> 00:54:26,142
Stop it...how but I hate gratitude!

763
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:27,838
it's a very debasing emotion.

764
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:29,434
You just keep your mind 
on the game.

765
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:30,945
That's Rule 1.

766
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:32,605
Rule 2...

767
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:41,675
Have you played this game before?

768
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:49,138
Maybe when you learn 
a little more about THESE people...

769
00:54:49,138 --> 00:54:51,815
...you might revise your opinions
about the Chinese.

770
00:54:51,815 --> 00:54:54,446
Maybe, but the farther west I've gone,
the more I'm convinced...

771
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:56,676
...that wisdom and civilisation 
come from the East.

772
00:54:56,676 --> 00:54:57,953
That's what I say!

773
00:54:57,953 --> 00:54:58,746
China!

774
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:00,768
Japan is east of China.

775
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:03,161
You should do well here, Mr Cassell.

776
00:55:04,338 --> 00:55:05,273
How about this?

777
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:20,838
Excuse me, gentlemen...
I'll see you later.

778
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:23,155
What is it....what's it all about?

779
00:55:23,979 --> 00:55:25,271
Colonel...this is an outrage!

780
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:26,954
I won't tolerate it!

781
00:55:26,954 --> 00:55:29,182
You seem to forget my position and influence.

782
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:32,167
Perhaps you do not have them 
any longer, Mr Cassell.

783
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:35,141
Have you seen His Excellency Baron Tanaka?

784
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:36,693
If he'd seen me, 
I wouldn't be here.

785
00:55:36,693 --> 00:55:38,227
Be reasonable, Colonel...

786
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:40,224
All you want was to hold till China be killed.

787
00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:42,415
It didn't happen the way we planned it, 
but what's the difference?

788
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:46,738
We are just as much concerned in the manner 
in which these matters are accomplished.

789
00:55:46,738 --> 00:55:50,818
Now, His Imperial Majesty's government 
will have to make it very clear...

790
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:53,088
...we were never acquainted with you.

791
00:55:53,413 --> 00:55:54,694
But where's that leave me?

792
00:55:54,694 --> 00:55:56,119
I've lost my friends in China, and now...

793
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,373
Precisely!

794
00:55:57,373 --> 00:55:59,636
Surely you must realise, Mr Cassell...

795
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:02,232
When he, who is not a good friend of China...

796
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:04,554
cannot be a good friend of Japan.

797
00:56:06,298 --> 00:56:07,235
Most regrettable.

798
00:56:09,185 --> 00:56:09,924
Good day.

799
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,980
OK...OK!

800
00:56:19,763 --> 00:56:21,140
Don't get me wrong, Condon...

801
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,698
I don't blame you...
It was my mistake...

802
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:24,144
I don't know what got into me.

803
00:56:24,144 --> 00:56:26,246
The Chinese are great people...
I love them...

804
00:56:26,246 --> 00:56:29,042
If you'd only come to me before 
printing the story, and stopped me...

805
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:30,510
Knocked some good sense into my head.

806
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,311
It isn't brains you're short of, Cassell...

807
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:33,460
I know but...

808
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,918
It was like doubling up...

809
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:36,254
Letting the money ride on a good bet...

810
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:37,539
I couldn't pass it up.

811
00:56:38,998 --> 00:56:40,188
Get out of here!

812
00:56:40,924 --> 00:56:41,312
Wait a minute...

813
00:56:41,312 --> 00:56:43,097
You're a decent icon...

814
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:44,839
And I've got an idea 
that'll work for both of us.

815
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,310
You're in a worse spot than I am.

816
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,154
They're not going to let you 
out of the country alive.

817
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,397
But they don't suspect me.

818
00:56:49,397 --> 00:56:51,814
You set the price...half a million...
anything you say...

819
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:54,848
Let me take it to China, and set myself up again 
with the right people...

820
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:56,196
You'll collect the money in America.

821
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:00,545
Take what to China?

822
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:01,174
The Tanaka plan.

823
00:57:01,174 --> 00:57:02,439
You've got it, Condon.

824
00:57:02,974 --> 00:57:04,876
Tanaka's already made you an offer...
but you're holding out for more.

825
00:57:04,876 --> 00:57:05,634
I know.

826
00:57:06,746 --> 00:57:07,049
Oh yeah?

827
00:57:09,232 --> 00:57:10,678
Well, what else do you know?

828
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:13,571
Plenty...didn't I frame the introduction...
for Tanaka...

829
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:14,930
...between you and the Hilliard dame?

830
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,838
Don't I know she hasn't had any luck yet
because you're playing cagey.

831
00:57:28,948 --> 00:57:30,010
What else?

832
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,971
That's funny...you smear me 
for selling out China...

833
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,218
...while you're selling out 
your own country.

834
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,570
Nick...what is this?

835
00:58:07,073 --> 00:58:08,982
Now that we know each other...
start talking!

836
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:10,541
Start talking...

837
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:28,521
You were at Yadakamado that night.

838
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:29,403
What if I was?

839
00:58:29,403 --> 00:58:30,494
- You work for Tanaka!
- No!

840
00:58:30,494 --> 00:58:31,305
That's a lie!

841
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:33,765
Thought you were going great, 
didn't you?

842
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:36,147
Had me shooting off my mouth about 
the wonderful Chinese people...

843
00:58:36,147 --> 00:58:37,168
Tied me up with Chang Po Ling...

844
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:40,083
You were going to have a case of espionage 
built up against me, and have me boxed.

845
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,441
I'd give up the Tanaka memorial...

846
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:44,115
...or else spend the next 10 years of my life 
in a dirty Jap prison.

847
00:58:44,115 --> 00:58:44,946
Very cute.

848
00:58:44,946 --> 00:58:46,609
But you made one slip!

849
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:49,066
You thought you'd build yourself up with me 
by spilling that story on Cassell.

850
00:58:49,066 --> 00:58:50,617
It didn't work!...He talked!

851
00:58:50,617 --> 00:58:51,586
Can I say something?

852
00:58:51,586 --> 00:58:52,324
Yes...plenty!...

853
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:53,807
To the United States embassy.

854
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:55,756
You're going to tell them 
how YOU killed Edith Miller!

855
00:58:55,756 --> 00:58:56,748
- I didn't!
-Well you know who did!

856
00:58:56,748 --> 00:58:58,190
And who killed her husband.

857
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,575
You go down into the sewer 
with dirty rats like Tanaka...

858
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:02,090
Then come to me with your
"Freedom for women"...

859
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:03,555
"Equal rights for all people"...

860
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:04,541
"Love of humanity"!

861
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,549
Well, who killed them?...the names...
Oshima and who else?

862
00:59:07,492 --> 00:59:09,114
What would you give 
for the names?

863
00:59:09,114 --> 00:59:10,840
The Tanaka memorial?

864
00:59:11,075 --> 00:59:13,026
It's too late for that kind of deal now.

865
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:15,736
What is your price then 
for the document?

866
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:19,998
That hardly answers my question.

867
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:24,520
Alright...I'll give it to you 
in your own language...

868
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,573
It may come as a surprise to you...
but these things can't buy everything.

869
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:31,391
There isn't money enough in all Japan,
to buy that document.

870
00:59:31,391 --> 00:59:32,864
What are you risking your life for?

871
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:36,077
To protect people in China and America 
that you don't even know?

872
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:37,704
To save humanity?

873
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:39,247
Come on...let's get over 
to the embassy.

874
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:40,463
Are you sure?

875
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:43,548
Are you sure you'd risk your life 
to protect the Tanaka plan?...

876
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:45,102
If you had it.

877
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:48,359
Oh, don't worry...I have it!

878
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,509
No, you haven't.

879
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:52,827
I have.

880
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:55,544
Is this more of your lies?

881
00:59:55,544 --> 00:59:57,150
No, Nick.

882
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,902
You wait on the terrace...
I'll bring it to you.

883
01:00:07,356 --> 01:00:08,590
Where'd you get this?

884
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:10,721
Where did you put it?

885
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:13,657
The portrait of the emperor 
held no fears for me.

886
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:15,721
- When the police left...
- Where were you?

887
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:17,378
In your garden.

888
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:20,149
it was an awfully good fight 
you put up, Nick.

889
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,181
But when Oshima hit you 
from behind...

890
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:23,805
He hits awfully hard.

891
01:00:30,932 --> 01:00:31,937
So this is it, eh?

892
01:00:33,002 --> 01:00:34,103
This is it.

893
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:37,163
"Memorial to His Imperial Majesty"
by Premier Tanaka.

894
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:40,244
Outlining the positive policy of Japan.

895
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:43,777
Tell me...
How close did I come?...

896
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:44,979
In my article the other day.

897
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:47,578
You missed, Nick...
by millions of square miles.

898
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:49,825
This is a plan for world conquest.

899
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:51,638
Manchuria is only the beginning.

900
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,100
All of China...then America...

901
01:00:54,595 --> 01:00:56,300
Oh no...wait a minute...

902
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:58,794
What do you think WE'll be doing 
when all of this is going on?

903
01:00:58,794 --> 01:00:59,810
Sleeping.

904
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,602
Until the bombs start falling on you...

905
01:01:01,602 --> 01:01:02,986
They're counting on that, Nick.

906
01:01:02,986 --> 01:01:05,835
That's why it's so important to get this 
to the outside world.

907
01:01:05,835 --> 01:01:07,768
To China...to YOUR country.

908
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:10,343
Now, before the plan goes 
into full operation.

909
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,541
Well, the Japanese are going 
to claim it's a forgery.

910
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:17,778
And they'll scream "Fraud!" 
all over the place.

911
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,289
What we've got to do 
is to find some means...

912
01:01:20,289 --> 01:01:23,424
....to keep them from 
squirming out of it.

913
01:01:23,424 --> 01:01:24,864
That can be done, too.

914
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:27,551
This document CAN be authenticated...

915
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:30,150
...with the signature of someone who was present 
when the plan was drawn up.

916
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:33,225
Are you sure of that?

917
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:36,196
I'm sure of that.

918
01:01:39,553 --> 01:01:40,795
Darling...

919
01:01:43,682 --> 01:01:44,953
How did you get mixed up in this?

920
01:01:44,953 --> 01:01:46,551
It's my work.

921
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:48,830
Well, I can think of easier ways 
of making a living.

922
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,468
Not for me.

923
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:53,188
Big payoff, eh?

924
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:54,476
Yes.

925
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:56,401
A free China.

926
01:01:57,905 --> 01:02:00,499
That's why I had to be so careful, Nick,
about telling you.

927
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:02,516
I had to be sure 
how you felt about it.

928
01:02:04,352 --> 01:02:05,145
And about you.

929
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:12,406
Nick...

930
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:17,738
The other evening I said I wished 
we'd met 2 years ago...

931
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:19,924
I couldn't tell you why then.

932
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,314
I suddenly became afraid...

933
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:25,895
...that the thing I wanted most for you 
to say yes...you'd take the chance...

934
01:02:25,895 --> 01:02:27,651
...would come too swiftly.

935
01:02:28,893 --> 01:02:31,146
It would end for us 
before it could begin.

936
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:35,448
I suddenly wanted the moment of your decision 
pushed back months...

937
01:02:36,277 --> 01:02:37,508
Years.

938
01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:41,709
Wait a minute, darling...
I'm still alive.

939
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:45,717
Yes, Nick...very much.

940
01:02:47,909 --> 01:02:50,547
So much so that...I can't bear 
to think of it otherwise.

941
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:09,686
Thank you.

942
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:11,449
Sit down.

943
01:03:13,606 --> 01:03:16,745
You are not displeased 
that I suddenly begged this cocktail?

944
01:03:16,745 --> 01:03:19,394
I intended to see you 
later this evening...

945
01:03:19,394 --> 01:03:22,410
But some rather important matters 
demand my attention.

946
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:28,196
I am concerned about your work.

947
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:31,318
I had hoped you might have completed 
your mission by now.

948
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:36,498
And that the document we seek 
might already be in your hands.

949
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:41,025
I should be very happy 
when all this is over and forgotten.

950
01:03:41,773 --> 01:03:45,380
I'm afraid that politics and intrigue 
are not my special talents.

951
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:49,633
Sometimes I get a little frightened.

952
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,508
I understand, Iris.

953
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:57,449
I promise...for you 
there will be no more politics.

954
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,276
No more intrigue...

955
01:04:00,276 --> 01:04:02,560
No more spying.

956
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:05,371
I should be very grateful.

957
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:07,247
It is I who am grateful.

958
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:11,780
In fact, I have brought you 
a little gift, in reward.

959
01:04:14,636 --> 01:04:18,068
It is something I picked up at the silversmith 
on my way over.

960
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:28,375
I guess you were expecting 
more rubies?

961
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:31,879
I haven't forgotten how you love them.

962
01:04:32,938 --> 01:04:34,817
Oh no...these are quite lovely.

963
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,718
"A virtuous woman, who can buy?

964
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:45,519
For her price is far above...rubies."

965
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:48,083
A quotation?

966
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:51,971
From the Christian Bible.

967
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,932
It should remind you 
of something else.

968
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,376
From the same source.

969
01:04:56,376 --> 01:05:03,989
The coins...count them...
30 coins...

970
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:07,422
30 pieces of silver!

971
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,914
No...I'm not going to kill you.

972
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:16,718
I'm going to give you a chance 
to save your life...

973
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:18,265
..and MY honor.

974
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:21,949
The fact that you betrayed 
me was discovered by Colonel Tojo.

975
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:24,633
I've managed to save face thus far...

976
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:27,845
...by informing him that your actions 
were part of a plan of mine...

977
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:31,016
...through which I could obtain the name 
of the traitor within our government...

978
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:32,162
...with whom you have been working.

979
01:05:33,822 --> 01:05:34,520
Now...

980
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,659
What is his name?

981
01:05:39,328 --> 01:05:40,834
Very well...

982
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:44,420
...you have 2 hours 
in which to make your decision.

983
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:48,886
If, at the end of that time, I do not receive 
a call from you, naming the traitor...

984
01:05:49,758 --> 01:05:52,301
...your fate will be 
in the hands of Colonel Tojo.

985
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:58,522
Weigh carefully the possibilities 
of such a future!

986
01:06:10,355 --> 01:06:14,869
Don't attempt to leave the hotel 
or use the telephone, as it will be useless.

987
01:06:16,198 --> 01:06:18,062
I will await your call.

988
01:06:32,954 --> 01:06:35,764
Get me the "Tokyo Chronicle" office please.

989
01:06:35,764 --> 01:06:40,899
Sorry...only calls to Baron Tanaka 
will be accepted from your suite.

990
01:07:11,263 --> 01:07:14,221
You will see that the woman is punished.

991
01:07:15,802 --> 01:07:18,170
Death, that comes quickly, 
is not punishment.

992
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:23,183
There are other forms which are slow, 
which must be painfully absorbed.

993
01:07:23,183 --> 01:07:24,955
Yes, Excellency!

994
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:27,715
I have plans for our divine emperor...

995
01:07:28,585 --> 01:07:30,021
For his rule, and power.

996
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:33,816
In the execution of these plans,
I have failed.

997
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:36,895
From my own stupidity 
I have been deceived...

998
01:07:36,895 --> 01:07:39,572
...and thus dishonored 
His Imperial Majesty.

999
01:07:41,748 --> 01:07:42,979
To you, Captain Yamamoto...

1000
01:07:44,156 --> 01:07:45,260
To you, Colonel Tojo...

1001
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:49,791
...I pass the sacred obligation 
which I have betrayed.

1002
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,128
I charge you a pledge...

1003
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:57,121
I pledge you, never to sheathe 
the sword of the samurai...

1004
01:07:57,121 --> 01:07:59,832
...until our victorious armies 
march as conquerors...

1005
01:07:59,832 --> 01:08:02,252
...through the streets 
of every capital of the world.

1006
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:05,129
I swear the same.

1007
01:08:05,129 --> 01:08:08,048
America will be crushed...
never to rise again.

1008
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:10,119
The gods are kind...

1009
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:14,131
I will be in the White House when Japan 
dictates her terms of peace.

1010
01:08:16,587 --> 01:08:20,642
Meet me before the shrine, 
where we will do what must be done.

1011
01:08:48,361 --> 01:08:50,583
Is everything in readiness?

1012
01:08:51,556 --> 01:08:53,313
Yes, Your Excellency.

1013
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:03,329
I have been considering 
your past services to us.

1014
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:06,397
They have not been without value.

1015
01:11:07,755 --> 01:11:08,975
Thank you, Colonel Tojo...

1016
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,556
You know, I've always been 
a friend of Japan's.

1017
01:11:12,425 --> 01:11:14,834
Japan does not forget her friends.

1018
01:11:14,834 --> 01:11:19,633
There is a way in which 
you can re-establish yourself.

1019
01:11:19,633 --> 01:11:24,161
An exclusive news story 
of the first magnitude.

1020
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:26,073
I'll be right over!
In a half an hour.

1021
01:11:32,905 --> 01:11:35,329
There must be something wrong, Charlie...
I've been trying to get her all morning.

1022
01:11:35,329 --> 01:11:36,908
Did Miss Hilliard have any visitors 
yesterday?

1023
01:11:36,908 --> 01:11:38,971
Yes...Baron Tanaka.

1024
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:40,157
Baron Tanaka!?

1025
01:11:40,157 --> 01:11:41,943
You know where he is now, don't you?

1026
01:11:41,943 --> 01:11:43,152
With his ancestors.

1027
01:11:43,152 --> 01:11:44,596
Come on...open up!

1028
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:46,773
There's something fishy 
about that press release.

1029
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:48,538
Where did Cassell come off...
to grab an exclusive?

1030
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:51,767
If you ask me, Charlie the stroke that killed Tanaka 
had a very sharp edge to it.

1031
01:11:53,026 --> 01:11:54,164
Oh, Miss Hilliard!

1032
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:29,037
Well?

1033
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:33,537
They didn't get her...
She took a run-out powder.

1034
01:12:40,184 --> 01:12:41,606
Could be after the baggage.

1035
01:12:45,244 --> 01:12:46,242
Come right in.

1036
01:13:20,816 --> 01:13:23,604
4-piece luggage...
now check please.

1037
01:13:23,604 --> 01:13:25,580
Alright...I'll take your word for it.

1038
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,284
Sorry...must count.

1039
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:46,774
Alright...let's get going.

1040
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,302
Have another drink.

1041
01:14:12,726 --> 01:14:14,527
- It's a frame, Nick.
- Easy...easy!

1042
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:17,048
Hijakata 'll be outside somewhere.

1043
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,204
She's had almost a week 
to contact you.

1044
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:22,003
Why does she wait till three hours 
before your boat sails.

1045
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:25,320
I told you that dame was no good...
She's trying to hang a spar up on you.

1046
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,058
Can't you see it?
Don't go, Nick, for the love of...

1047
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:32,984
Let me see who it is.

1048
01:14:32,984 --> 01:14:34,194
No, you wait here.

1049
01:14:38,745 --> 01:14:40,210
It's Johnny Clarke from the embassy.

1050
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,618
I'm certainly relieved 
to find you here, Nick.

1051
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,040
Why...where did you expect 
to find me?

1052
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,375
Frankly, in a Japanese dungeon.

1053
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:47,479
I told you.

1054
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:48,238
What's the story?

1055
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:50,338
You've got a friend somewhere 
on this island, Nick...

1056
01:14:50,338 --> 01:14:52,634
We received a phone call from him 
at the embassy, 20 minutes ago.

1057
01:14:52,634 --> 01:14:53,697
Who was it?

1058
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:54,041
Anonymous.

1059
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,510
A warrant is to be sworn out 
for your arrest.

1060
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:59,393
You're to be held for questioning, 
suspected of being a Chinese agent.

1061
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:01,608
The ambassador sent me over in HIS car.

1062
01:15:01,608 --> 01:15:04,502
Official American property 
can't be violated.

1063
01:15:04,502 --> 01:15:07,392
So...I'm to put you on the "Wilson" at once...
in the charge of the captain.

1064
01:15:07,392 --> 01:15:09,923
Great...you'll be immune...
You'll be a diplomatic pouch.

1065
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:10,888
It's the only way Nick...

1066
01:15:10,888 --> 01:15:12,986
If they once catch you, 
it's a long legal tangle.

1067
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:15,798
Before we can do anything...
weeks...maybe months.

1068
01:15:15,798 --> 01:15:18,466
Come on Nick...bon voyage...
Now get going!

1069
01:15:22,355 --> 01:15:23,348
Thanks, Johnny...

1070
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:25,301
I'll see you at the embassy
 in about an hour.

1071
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:31,431
Well...we won't be responsible, 
you know.

1072
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:27,800
Mr Condon!

1073
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:19,091
Light up in there.

1074
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:35,085
A whole week...
and not a word from you.

1075
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:38,201
I couldn't get a word to you before this.

1076
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:39,970
You could have gotten word 
to me some way!

1077
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:42,608
You still don't trust me.

1078
01:17:47,623 --> 01:17:48,812
I do trust you.

1079
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:51,730
I worked that out myself, an hour ago.

1080
01:17:55,151 --> 01:17:57,678
I think I can prove to you 
that it was worth it.

1081
01:18:01,222 --> 01:18:01,983
Come with me.

1082
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:21,883
Mr Condon...

1083
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:24,261
I'm quite certain you will agree...

1084
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:26,964
...there is very little time 
to waste on explanation.

1085
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:33,939
Miss Hilliard and I feel it would 
serve our purpose most effectively...

1086
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:36,120
...if I signed the document 
in your presence.

1087
01:18:53,081 --> 01:18:55,876
Naturally, when this is made public...

1088
01:18:55,876 --> 01:18:58,295
...its authenticity will not go unchallenged.

1089
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:02,401
My signature will be branded a forgery,
by our government...

1090
01:19:02,401 --> 01:19:04,110
...including the emperor.

1091
01:19:04,756 --> 01:19:08,448
In that event, Your Highness,
your voice will give them the lie.

1092
01:19:10,237 --> 01:19:11,483
The length of elapsed time... 

1093
01:19:11,483 --> 01:19:14,485
...between the publication of this document 
and my ability to speak...

1094
01:19:15,722 --> 01:19:16,732
...will be very brief.

1095
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,075
In Japan...a traitor's voice 
is quickly silenced.

1096
01:19:29,066 --> 01:19:33,727
Mr Condon. I take my part in this...
not for YOUR country...

1097
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,236
...but for mine.

1098
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,770
I would rather see Japan defeated...

1099
01:19:39,634 --> 01:19:43,198
...than triumphant under the heels 
of our militarists.

1100
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:34,214
Lady...would you mind very much 
if I were to kiss you?

1101
01:20:36,022 --> 01:20:39,171
I don't believe I'd have the strength 
to move from this spot, until you did.

1102
01:20:48,894 --> 01:20:50,392
And now...we've got to 
get out of here.

1103
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:51,295
It's all been arranged.

1104
01:20:51,703 --> 01:20:55,005
In a few minutes, a fishing boat will take us 
to a freighter on the lower bay.

1105
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:56,786
Us?

1106
01:20:56,786 --> 01:20:58,894
You're going with me, Nick.

1107
01:20:58,894 --> 01:21:00,572
They're planning to hold you 
for questioning.

1108
01:21:00,572 --> 01:21:01,539
Once they get you...

1109
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:05,821
I had an idea it was you who warned the embassy 
there was a warrant out for me.

1110
01:21:05,821 --> 01:21:08,008
They want to send me out 
with diplomatic immunity.

1111
01:21:08,008 --> 01:21:11,529
Diplomatic immunity won't stop a bullet,
or a bomb under a car.

1112
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,531
Rough, are they?

1113
01:21:14,518 --> 01:21:15,508
Leave with us, Nick...

1114
01:21:16,002 --> 01:21:16,951
For me.

1115
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,313
For you?!

1116
01:21:21,108 --> 01:21:22,399
Are you worth that?

1117
01:21:25,698 --> 01:21:26,628
Alright!

1118
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:28,791
Why didn't you tell me?

1119
01:22:32,593 --> 01:22:34,427
Nick...this way...

1120
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:40,371
Wait...

1121
01:22:45,464 --> 01:22:46,899
Police everywhere...hurry!

1122
01:22:51,777 --> 01:22:52,772
You'll have to take it out, darling...

1123
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:54,775
I'll hold them here, 
till you get a start.

1124
01:22:55,902 --> 01:22:57,240
No...they'll kill you!

1125
01:23:00,164 --> 01:23:00,816
Get going!

1126
01:23:00,816 --> 01:23:03,913
Nick!...if they'll kill you...
The plan is all they want!

1127
01:23:05,737 --> 01:23:06,891
We can't do that!

1128
01:23:10,582 --> 01:23:13,308
We've got jobs to do...nobody gave them to us
but they've got to be done...

1129
01:23:15,008 --> 01:23:16,107
You're my girl, aren't you?

1130
01:23:18,213 --> 01:23:19,544
You're going to do 
what I want you to do...

1131
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:20,528
I know it's tough...

1132
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:22,332
It's tougher to go than it is to stay...

1133
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:24,521
...but you can't hold them, 
and I think I can.

1134
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:26,247
Alright, Nick.

1135
01:23:27,403 --> 01:23:28,393
I'm your girl.

1136
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:08,009
Given up strangling...eh, Oshima?

1137
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,466
Oh, that's right...
you HAD given it up...

1138
01:24:11,466 --> 01:24:14,626
You shot Ollie Miller...

1139
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:16,920
It was his wife who was strangled, 
wasn't it?

1140
01:24:17,411 --> 01:24:18,200
Yes!

1141
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,846
I see your point...

1142
01:24:20,846 --> 01:24:22,751
When it comes to taking a man 
with your bare hands...

1143
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:24,169
...it's rather risky, isn't it?

1144
01:24:24,169 --> 01:24:25,937
You're very clever Mr Condon...

1145
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:28,134
...but there's one flaw 
in your cleverness...

1146
01:24:28,134 --> 01:24:31,552
It's as easy to kill you with these...
as with that!

1147
01:24:31,552 --> 01:24:33,405
In fact, I prefer it that way!

1148
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,084
Japanese-fashion!

1149
01:29:20,752 --> 01:29:22,997
Kabé...check the men!

1150
01:29:46,318 --> 01:29:48,253
Condon has escaped from the docks.

1151
01:29:51,129 --> 01:29:52,501
Now he comes here.

1152
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:56,094
Driver!...

1153
01:29:57,948 --> 01:29:59,589
Drive past Haka Street.

1154
01:31:52,862 --> 01:31:53,758
Look at this!

1155
01:31:58,988 --> 01:32:00,405
So sorry, Mr Condon...

1156
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,937
...to take plan from you...

1157
01:32:02,937 --> 01:32:06,675
But you see...
Japanese very smart!

1158
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:09,864
Only half-smart, flunky!

1159
01:32:09,864 --> 01:32:11,798
Only half-smart.

1160
01:32:18,093 --> 01:32:19,145
Get out of my way!

1161
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:24,001
Hello, fella!

1162
01:32:24,594 --> 01:32:26,387
I said I'd be back in an hour...

1163
01:32:26,387 --> 01:32:27,987
Sorry I'm a few minutes late.

1164
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:30,299
Yamada, this is not going 
to be treated... 

1165
01:32:30,299 --> 01:32:32,522
...as another of your 
very regrettable mistakes!

1166
01:32:32,522 --> 01:32:35,117
Condon is an enemy of Imperial Japan...

1167
01:32:35,117 --> 01:32:35,897
Insist he must be...

1168
01:32:39,996 --> 01:32:42,976
Extremely sorry this has been 
the result, Mr Clarke...

1169
01:32:42,976 --> 01:32:46,048
It is true, Condon has been 
enemy of Japan...

1170
01:32:46,048 --> 01:32:49,482
But Japanese people very good...
very generous.

1171
01:32:50,496 --> 01:32:53,214
We will forget bad actions of Condon 
and say no more.

1172
01:32:54,413 --> 01:32:57,174
You, in turn will forget this incident?

1173
01:32:57,174 --> 01:32:58,928
What's the matter, Yamada?

1174
01:32:59,726 --> 01:33:01,501
Afraid of the penalty for failure?

1175
01:33:01,501 --> 01:33:03,819
What is much simpler this way...

1176
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:05,623
Both sides have made mistake.

1177
01:33:05,979 --> 01:33:08,439
Will be very embarrassing for all.

1178
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:11,820
The United States government 
doesn't settle for a deal, Yamada.

1179
01:33:13,578 --> 01:33:14,746
Condon San...

1180
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:20,882
Condon San...you have saying...
"Forgive your enemies"

1181
01:33:20,882 --> 01:33:23,288
I am willing.

1182
01:33:24,651 --> 01:33:27,483
Sure...forgive your enemies!

1183
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:30,118
But, first, get even!

1184
01:33:41,278 --> 02:19:47,185

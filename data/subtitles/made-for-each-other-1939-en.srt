1
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,648
Sorry.

2
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,575
- Morning, Mr. Mason.
- Good morning.

3
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,994
- Hello, Johnny.
- Lovely morning.

4
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,621
- Hi, Johnny.
- Beautiful morning.

5
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,165
- Morning, Mr. Mason.
- Harry, it's a marvelous morning.

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,376
Have a nice trip? Sensational.

7
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,586
- Great city, Boston.
- Terrific.

8
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,853
Happy bridegroom, yoo-hoo!

9
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,865
- How did you meet her, John?
- Johnny, what's she like?

10
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,451
Wait a minute. I can't describe her.
Nobody can.

11
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,913
But I happen to have
a photograph of her here.

12
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,585
- Well, well, well.
- Hello, Carter.

13
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,503
So you combined business with pleasure.

14
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,922
Wait till Judge Doolittle hears about this,
my boy.

15
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,550
- About what?
- About your getting married on his time...

16
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,886
without his consent, or his daughter's.

17
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,389
- What's she got to do with it?
- The chief topic of conversation here...

18
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,767
- has been that you and Miss Doolittle...
- Malarkey! Office talk, Carter.

19
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,812
- Isn't a word of truth in it.
- Judge Doolittle may not think so.

20
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,024
Is that so? Well, if he doesn't
like it, he can lump it.

21
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,168
Good morning, Judge Doolittle.

22
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,174
What's all this mess?

23
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,137
Well, it seems that everybody around here
found out that I...

24
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,097
When I was up in Boston...

25
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,642
- What were you doing in Boston?
- You sent me, sir.

26
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,312
You sent me up there to get a deposition
on the Higgins v. Higgins case.

27
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,772
- Did you get it?
- Yes, sir.

28
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,732
Well, what's all this horseplay?

29
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,653
While I was in Boston, after I got the
deposition, I had a few hours to spare...

30
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,488
and so I...

31
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,366
- Just a few hours...
- Go on.

32
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,493
I got married.

33
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,745
- You what?
- I got married.

34
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,249
- You got married?
- Yes, sir, I got married.

35
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,085
- Come into my office.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,848
Where's the deposition?

37
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,522
There you are, sir.

38
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,359
What's this?

39
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,786
That's just sort of a letter.

40
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,497
- So you got married?
- Yes, sir.

41
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,834
I imagine this will be a surprise
to some people.

42
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,168
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,549
No, sir, I mean...

44
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,385
I don't know.
It all happened rather suddenly.

45
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,222
We met on Boston Common
the night I arrived.

46
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,934
I'd had a bite at Thompson's spa...

47
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,895
and then I took a little stroll
around the Common...

48
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,982
and I saw her standing there.

49
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,901
She was just standing there.

50
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,529
She had a cinder in her eye.

51
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,657
- Where?
- In her eye.

52
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,911
- Whose eye?
- Jane's. Mrs. Mason, my wife.

53
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,168
Of course, she wasn't my wife then.
She's my wife now, though.

54
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,630
I got the cinder out of her eye...

55
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,674
- And you married her.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,052
- Quick work, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,806
Judge, we knew
the moment we looked at each...

58
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,893
We knew
the moment we looked at each other.

59
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,603
- You did?
- Yes, sir.

60
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,691
Last year, there were nearly
half a million divorces in this country.

61
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,110
Congratulations, Mason.

62
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,864
Thank you very much, sir.

63
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,077
Mr. Hutch would like
your opinion on this, sir.

64
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,538
This is for you, Mr. Mason.
Special messenger.

65
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,874
It's marked, "Rush. Important."

66
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,003
Rush? Important? What is it?

67
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,923
- It's nothing.
- What is it?

68
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,010
It's a letter from my wife.

69
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,347
Your wife?
What did you do, leave her in Boston?

70
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,766
- No, she's right here, sir.
- Here, in town?

71
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,850
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,520
If your wife's in town,
why did she write you a letter?

73
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,688
She likes to write letters, Judge.

74
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,900
It's sort of a little custom we have.

75
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,611
She wrote me a letter
the first day she met me...

76
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,154
right as soon as she got home.

77
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,031
She's written me one ever since.

78
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,700
Even coming down on the train together,
she wrote me.

79
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,078
You see, when I get a letter from her...

80
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,957
it's sort of like a visit, you see.

81
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,710
Judge...

82
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:06,174
when two people get married,
they usually go on a honeymoon.

83
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,636
I didn't. I don't approve of honeymoons.
Waste of time.

84
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,933
Well, you know how women are,
and Mrs. Mason and I...

85
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,977
What about Higgins v. Higgins?

86
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,689
You're the only one who knows this case.
It's on the calendar for next week.

87
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,734
- If I could get a continuance...
- Opposing counsel wouldn't consent.

88
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,114
But I talked to Mr. Hornblow this morning,
and he agreed to a continuance.

89
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,242
Well, all right. Take a week.

90
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,661
A week?

91
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, Judge, I'm afraid
we wouldn't be able to make it in a week.

92
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,043
What?

93
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,754
- We couldn't make it in a week.
- Make what?

94
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:50,218
My wife and I had sort of planned
a trip to Europe on the Normandie.

95
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,514
Take two weeks then.

96
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,415
And after I got the cinder
out of Jane's eye...

97
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,751
we talked for a little while...

98
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,421
and then we took a little walk
around the Commons.

99
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,632
Yes?

100
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,844
We walked for quite some time...

101
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,805
then we went over to Thompson's spa
for a bite.

102
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,308
Yes?

103
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,394
And we had a bite.

104
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,902
Well, rather an unconventional meeting,
wasn't it?

105
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,827
- These cookies are delicious.
- They're made with sour cream.

106
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,331
- I'm crazy about sour cream.
- I'm crazy about Jane.

107
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,047
- John is so young and impulsive.
- Mother, wait a minute.

108
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,049
This is different.

109
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,594
Are you visiting relatives
here in New York, my dear?

110
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,724
Yes and no. Not exactly.

111
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,310
- I came over with Johnny.
- From Boston?

112
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,063
Together? Last night?

113
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,816
Yes, Mother.

114
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,695
We thought as long as we were engaged...

115
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,155
Engaged?

116
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,950
I know how upset you must be, Mrs. Mason.

117
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,869
You know so little about me,
and it all happened so suddenly.

118
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,205
Well, I should think it was sudden.

119
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,170
- What did your family have to say about it?
- I have no family.

120
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,428
Didn't John say something
about your taking a course in journalism?

121
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,055
Yes, but I gave it up after I met Johnny.

122
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,058
I'm sort of a post-graduate course.

123
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,146
My dear, if you have a
talent for writing...

124
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,773
take my advice
and develop it while you're young.

125
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,985
One needs all one's time and energy
for a career.

126
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,362
Don't you think
marriage is a career in itself?

127
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,366
Indeed. Emphatically. That's why
one mustn't rush into it pell-mell.

128
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,494
Marriage is a business,
a very serious business.

129
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,081
A partnership,
in the strictest sense of the word.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,709
One must prepare for it.

131
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,670
There are so many things to learn.

132
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,677
Jane will learn all of those
after we're married.

133
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,640
I hope and pray that that day will not come
for many years.

134
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,645
Mother, what do you mean?
Do you mean we shouldn't?

135
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,146
Emphatically not.

136
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,775
There's no reason for Jane
to develop into a little household drudge.

137
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,486
I hope you understand,
I have nothing against Jane.

138
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,530
In fact, I like her. I like her very much.

139
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,535
I'm glad you do, Mother, because...

140
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,205
You remember a little while ago
you asked Jane...

141
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,291
whether she'd come to New York
to visit relatives?

142
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:12,462
As a matter of fact,
she has come to New York to visit...

143
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,632
She's visiting some right now. You see...

144
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,011
We're married.

145
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,652
Mother, everybody gets married
sooner or later.

146
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,946
- Get the smelling salts.
- What do they look like?

147
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,281
Mother, where are the smelling salts?

148
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,704
What's done is done.

149
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,957
You'll have children of your own,
I suppose...

150
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,626
and you'll love them
and devote your life to them.

151
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,671
Then they'll grow up and leave you,
and you'll say to yourself:

152
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,090
"It's all right, that's the way it is."

153
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,175
"You've served your purpose."

154
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,761
Mother, don't excite yourself anymore.

155
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,805
I'm all right now.

156
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,477
I wish you
every possible happiness and joy.

157
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,023
I think perhaps I'd better go to bed.
I'm all right.

158
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,407
I'll find a place to live, of course.

159
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,327
Some place to live?
Of course not, Mother. You'll stay with us.

160
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,915
We're going to find a new apartment.
We've talked this all over.

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,086
- Jane will insist. Won't you, darling?
- We couldn't think of anything else.

162
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,464
Well, we'll see.

163
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,518
See? I told you it would be all right.

164
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,607
Johnny, maybe we shouldn't have
gotten married.

165
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,068
Maybe we shouldn't have
gotten married at all.

166
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,414
All visitors ashore, please.

167
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,837
- Don't let him eat too many strawberries.
- I won't.

168
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,214
He gets rashes.

169
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,674
Don't forget to make him wear his raincoat
in London.

170
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,384
- I won't.
- He had pneumonia once.

171
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,054
Mother, that was 12 years ago.
I feel fine now.

172
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,140
- And take good care of yourself, too.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Mason.

173
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,142
Take good care of him.

174
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,521
Goodbye, Mother.

175
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,440
Mother, it's only two weeks, you know.

176
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,776
- I know. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

177
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,781
- What's this?
- The heating pad. You forgot to pack it.

178
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,833
Here it is.

179
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,294
What do you think of it?

180
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,964
- It's cozy.
- It's the only one they had left.

181
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,677
- I think we can do better after the boat sails.
- What for? I love it. It's so intimate.

182
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,929
- What's this?
- That's nothing.

183
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,057
Is it something somebody gave you?
I know, it's something for me!

184
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,893
- It is! Let me see it!
- It's something I forgot to pack.

185
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,521
What are you being so mysterious about?
Let me see it.

186
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,398
Really, it's nothing, Jane.

187
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:23,570
I bet it's a going away present. You can't
fool me. You shouldn't have done this.

188
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,450
Johnny, you fool.

189
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,747
Gee whiz, I couldn't
leave it in the office.

190
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,384
- What?
- When I was in school, I was taught that...

191
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,470
two things can't occupy the same place
at the same time.

192
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,555
What?

193
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,521
We'll get the steward
to get us a bigger bed.

194
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,149
You couldn't get a bigger bed
in here, though.

195
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,193
- I think it's big enough.
- Wait till you try and turn round.

196
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,987
- Is it all right?
- Sure it is.

197
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,531
Let's see. That's not so bad.

198
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,828
Why, there's oceans of room here.

199
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,916
Johnny, this is the first time in my life
I've ever been away from America.

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,210
- Me, too.
- Isn't it just beautiful?

201
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,297
Yeah, I guess so.

202
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,883
What, Johnny?

203
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,178
Do you remember that cinder
I took out of your eye in Boston?

204
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,512
I'll never forget it.

205
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,599
You know, I threw that away.
I shouldn't have done that.

206
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,394
I should have kept that cinder.
Put it in a locket or something.

207
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,648
If it hadn't been for that cinder,
maybe we'd never have met.

208
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,609
Don't say that, Johnny. We had to meet.

209
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,070
Yeah, I guess you're right.

210
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,784
- Still, if it hadn't been for that cinder...
- Johnny, isn't it just beautiful?

211
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,499
- Bon voyage, darling.
- Bon voyage.

212
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,547
- Where is Stateroom 504?
- First room to your left, sir.

213
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,844
Come in.

214
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,808
- Hello, Carter. Nice of you to come down.
- Judge Doolittle sent me.

215
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,934
He did?

216
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,355
Carter, this is Miss... Mrs...

217
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,109
This is my wife.
Darling, Mr. Carter from the office.

218
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,652
- How do you do?
- Happy to know you.

219
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,780
Good thing I got here in time.
You've got just about 10 minutes.

220
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,366
- Ten minutes for what?
- To get off the boat.

221
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,912
- To get off... What are you talking about?
- Higgins v. Higgins.

222
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:42,041
- What about Higgins v. Higgins?
- It goes on the calendar for next week.

223
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,920
No, that's where you're mistaken.
I got a continuance for a whole month.

224
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,131
- You think you did.
- I did!

225
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,175
You ask Hornblow about it.
He gave me his word of honor.

226
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,927
Well, you know Hornblow.

227
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,179
Johnny, they can't do this to you.

228
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,391
- No, they can't do this...
- Does Doolittle think he's a puppet?

229
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,185
- What does he think I am, a puppet?
- Some kind of a pawn...

230
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,896
- he can push any way he likes?
- Push all over the place.

231
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,066
- Is that what you want me to tell Doolittle?
- Yes.

232
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,405
Carter, wait a minute.

233
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,158
Are you sure
that case is going on next week?

234
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,952
- Monday morning at 9:00 a.m.
- Monday morning.

235
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,455
Look, will you excuse us just a minute?

236
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,124
- I'm glad you said that.
- Yeah, sure.

237
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,752
Higgins v. Higgins
is a pretty important case.

238
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,088
I don't care. It isn't as important
as our honeymoon, is it?

239
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,132
Of course not, darling, but...

240
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,760
- What's the matter?
- You've got lipstick on your mouth.

241
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,678
A lawyer is like a doctor or soldier.

242
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,722
You've got to disregard
your own convenience.

243
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,600
Convenience?
You don't call this a convenience.

244
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,020
Listen, darling.
I'd tell Doolittle to jump in the lake...

245
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,022
even at that the risk of losing my job.

246
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,484
But if I win the case,
I get a chance to go in with the firm.

247
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,322
And a firm like this...

248
00:17:55,866 --> 00:18:00,244
But it's my honeymoon,
and Doolittle knows it's my honeymoon.

249
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,541
There are just some things
a man just can't do.

250
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,777
That Carter thought it was funny.
He laughed.

251
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,947
I hate that liver-pill.

252
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,991
If they ever try
pulling anything like this again...

253
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,452
I hate that Judge Do-nothing.

254
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,039
I wish someone would step
on that ear-thing of his.

255
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,294
- We still have the tickets here.
- I hope Higgins beats Higgins.

256
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,999
The alligator pears, Annie.

257
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,628
- It's your mother-in-law.
- Hello, dear.

258
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,673
Would you mind fixing the place cards
for me? I'm so late.

259
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,092
- They're right there on the desk.
- Certainly, dear.

260
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:42,680
The girl took so long to fix my hair,
I didn't get out of the place till 6:30.

261
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,432
It's still sopping wet.

262
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,018
You should have made
an earlier appointment.

263
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,854
Yes, I should.

264
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,107
I thought I'd put Judge Doolittle
on my right, of course.

265
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,233
Naturally.

266
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,153
And Mr. Carter, I suppose
I'll have to have him on my left.

267
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,322
You seem to think
I've never done this before.

268
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,199
No, dear, it's just that I never have.

269
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,035
You have the wineglasses
on the wrong side, Annie.

270
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,704
The left side was the right side
where I worked before.

271
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,332
The right side was the
water glasses, Annie.

272
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,171
- How do you think the table looks?
- Isn't it a little crowded?

273
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,423
That girl will drive me crazy.

274
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,594
The things that pop up at the last minute.

275
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,305
I had to borrow finger bowls
from the woman downstairs...

276
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,098
because we only had four.

277
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,728
- Are you sitting on Johnny's right?
- I always have been.

278
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,731
I thought I'd put Miss Doolittle
there tonight.

279
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,484
Of course, it's your party, my dear.

280
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,862
Just this once. Do you mind?

281
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,198
No, of course not.

282
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,203
You know, I used to think that
John and Eunice Doolittle...

283
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,413
- Yes?
- There was nothing in it.

284
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,124
But a lovely girl.

285
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,127
Would you see
if Annie has the appetizers fixed?

286
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,671
Of course, my dear.

287
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,305
I think you have too many on the plate.
And shouldn't they be garnished?

288
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,599
Where's the silver tray,
the one I gave them?

289
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,310
I don't know how many hands
they expect you to have here.

290
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,230
There's just so much a body can do.
I'm only human.

291
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,025
I'll fix the canapés for you,
as you seem to have so much to do.

292
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,153
A little bit too much vinegar
in the salad dressing, I'm afraid.

293
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,446
I'm only human.

294
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,991
Your potatoes aren't going to burn,
are they?

295
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,326
I'm afraid you put them on too early.

296
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,873
- I'm leaving.
- You're what?

297
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,252
Right now. You can stand just so much,
and I'm only human.

298
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,504
But you can't do that. What's the matter?

299
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,298
I can't please everybody.

300
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,218
But, Annie,
my guests will be here any minute.

301
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,855
Well, I'll see you through dinner,
but I'm leaving at 9:00 sharp...

302
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,649
in order to catch the 9:30 ferry boat
to Staten Island.

303
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,152
And nobody's going to stop me.
I'm only human.

304
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,945
Watch the potatoes, Annie.

305
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,785
Dear, Annie has so much to do
with the extra guests and everything.

306
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,913
Don't you think we'd better humor
her tonight and leave her alone?

307
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,499
But you asked me to see about the canapés.

308
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,254
I know, but it's a lot for one person to do.
Too many of us giving orders upsets her.

309
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,340
I was only trying to help.

310
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,259
There's Johnny.

311
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,849
I bet you forgot the wine.

312
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,896
Old Granite Puss' favorite tipple.
I called up Doolittle's club and found out.

313
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,899
Pretty nice, huh?
It's Burgundy and it sparkles.

314
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,776
Here, have Annie chill it, Mother.

315
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,446
They'll be here any minute.
You'd better hurry up and get dressed.

316
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,158
How's everything going?

317
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,411
Everything's lovely. An ultimatum
from Annie, and this one's final.

318
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,205
- She's through tonight.
- Tonight?

319
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,124
It's all right, though.
She'll see us through dinner.

320
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,961
I don't see why you have servant trouble.
We have all the help we want at work.

321
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,547
I'd like to change places with you
just for one day.

322
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,883
What did you do with the witch hazel?

323
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,261
I didn't have it. Look on the third shelf,
back of the eyewash.

324
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,931
You're always putting things behind things.

325
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,684
That was a brilliant idea,
asking Eunice Doolittle at the last minute.

326
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,938
She and the Judge are like
corned beef and cabbage, always together.

327
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,483
And that impossible twerp, Carter.
I suppose you had to ask him, too?

328
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,445
Eunice had some sort of a date with Carter,
so what could I do?

329
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,117
I not only do all that guy's work for him,
I feed him, as well.

330
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,746
It's all going to be different
when my name goes up on that door.

331
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,624
- You really think so?
- It's practically up there now.

332
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,835
- What's for dinner tonight?
- Roast beef.

333
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,753
Roast beef? Doolittle's delight!

334
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,798
I wanted Yorkshire pudding,
but Annie's never heard of it.

335
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,009
It's all right. Between roast beef
and Higgins v. Higgins...

336
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,553
how can we lose?

337
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:54,140
Yes, sir, that's going to be all right,
my name up there on the door:

338
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,975
- Doolittle.
- Messerschmidt.

339
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,394
- Doolittle.
- Hutch.

340
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,980
And Mason.

341
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,611
Didn't I win my motion for a new trial
in Higgins v. Higgins?

342
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,240
- I had a memo from Doolittle today.
- You did? What did he say?

343
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,409
Said he couldn't have
handled it better himself.

344
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,495
When he eats from your table tonight,
he'll eat out of my hand.

345
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,832
- And will I tell Carter.
- And will we hop the Normandie.

346
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,002
- Will we go places.
- And will we do things.

347
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,380
- I don't like that tie. Wear the blue one.
- Holy Mackerel!

348
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,968
- Johnny, does your name have to be last?
- For the time being, anyway.

349
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,512
Do you know what it means
to get into a firm like that?

350
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,474
You know what it means to a firm
to get a man like you in it?

351
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,184
Here, hook me up.

352
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:43,606
- That's a pretty nice neck you've got there.
- As nice as Eunice Doolittle's?

353
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,067
What do I know about her neck?
Never even noticed she had one.

354
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,196
You know what time it is?
Get dressed, will you?

355
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,406
- I am dressed.
- Come on, then.

356
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,576
Old Granite Puss will be here any minute.

357
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,203
Good evening.

358
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:06,212
Judge, good evening. We were just...
I have great news for you tonight, Judge.

359
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,256
We're having roast beef for dinner.

360
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,775
Would you care for some more wine,
Judge Doolittle?

361
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,818
- What's that?
- More wine?

362
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,195
Yes, thank you.

363
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:35,074
- Annie, some more wine for Judge Doolittle.
- There ain't any more.

364
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,265
Annie, a salad fork for Judge Doolittle.

365
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,309
I put one there.

366
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,027
The funniest thing happened
the other day, Judge.

367
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,197
I ran across the yearbook
of my husband's class in college.

368
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,450
In their prophecy, he was picked
as the one most likely to succeed.

369
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,870
- What's that?
- The other day, I ran across the yearbook...

370
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,999
of my husband's class in college,
and in the class prophecy...

371
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,208
Yes.

372
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,891
Higgins v. Higgins
is a pretty important case, isn't it'?

373
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,728
We like to think
all of our cases are important.

374
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,689
The little client of today
may be the big client of tomorrow.

375
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,649
You're so right, Judge.

376
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,194
For instance,
we got a client the other day...

377
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,872
Oh, dear.
What happened to your ice cream, Annie?

378
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,374
I told you to get that icebox fixed.

379
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,231
Annie, give this note to Mr. Mason.

380
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,739
Is it true something new is going to happen
in the firm this week?

381
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,115
- Excuse me.
- What?

382
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,825
Excuse me, please.

383
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,079
Yes, we're going to have
a blood transfusion.

384
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,956
I'm only speaking
metaphorically, of course.

385
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,293
What I mean is that we're getting
some new blood into the firm...

386
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,212
appointing a junior partner.

387
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,175
- Could you stay and serve the coffee?
- No.

388
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,805
- All right, here's $7. I'll send you...
- I want my $12 now!

389
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,391
All right, Annie. I'll get it for you.

390
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,435
I'll get it, maybe.

391
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,897
That's the way we keep an old firm young.

392
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,608
- Doing this...
- Excuse me, please.

393
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,610
Every five years.

394
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,737
But it's quite a job to pick the right man.

395
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,824
I shouldn't think so.
Surely it's a question of merit?

396
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,911
As a rule, I trust my own judgment,
but when it comes to picking men...

397
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,080
Excuse me, please.

398
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,792
I think there's nothing
like a woman's intuition.

399
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,752
You're so right, Judge.

400
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,130
Of course,
Eunice doesn't know much about law.

401
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,925
But she's traveled all over the world,
and she does know people.

402
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,888
Five years ago, it was at her suggestion
that I took Mr. Hutch into the firm.

403
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,017
- It worked out so well...
- I beg your pardon. I'm very sorry.

404
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,104
This year, I have again
consulted my daughter.

405
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:57,317
And now a new name moves up
on the door of our offices.

406
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,070
Beginning next Monday,
the name of the firm will be...

407
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,866
Doolittle, Messerschmidt,
Doolittle, Hutch...

408
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,534
and Carter.

409
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,296
Congratulations. That's
wonderful, isn't it?

410
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,594
I always knew you had it in you, Carter.

411
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,391
I'd like to propose a toast
to the new partner...

412
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,271
but we seem to have run out of...

413
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,693
There isn't any more wine.

414
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,598
May I have some notepaper
and an envelope, please?

415
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,933
Certainly.

416
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,604
Thank you.

417
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,238
0, Columbia, the gem of the ocean.

418
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,074
- Would you like a stamp?
- No, thank you.

419
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,580
- Could I have a safety pin, please?
- Surely.

420
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,043
Thank you.

421
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,057
And I tell you, gentlemen of the jury...

422
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,893
that the defendant, Higgins,
with unbrotherly venom...

423
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:59,231
and motivated solely by a desire,
maliciously and hatefully...

424
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,109
to interfere with his brother's rights
and privileges...

425
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,988
deliberately and improperly diverted
the waters of the stream.

426
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,867
Gentlemen, I leave the determination
of these matters in your hands...

427
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:14,872
confident that your verdict will bring justice
to my client, the plaintiff in this action.

428
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,547
Gentlemen of the jury,
you will now retire to arrive at a verdict.

429
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,268
Jane, how long have you been here?

430
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,730
I got here just as you started
your summation. It was wonderful.

431
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,357
You should have been here
when I cross-examined Higgins.

432
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,234
- Your Higgins?
- No, the other one.

433
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,819
You skinned him alive.

434
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,196
I tore him apart. I really cut him up.

435
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,173
"The party of the second part wishes to
announce to the party of the first part..."

436
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:11,261
"that we're going to be in the market for a lot
of these for the party of the third part."

437
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,451
- Congratulations, Mr. Mason.
- Good work.

438
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,328
You did a swell job.

439
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,546
- How is she?
- She's fine. Everything was fine.

440
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,174
The baby weighs 7 pounds, 1.3 ounces.

441
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,013
- Is this mine?
- This is your boy.

442
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,692
- Now he's all yours, Mr. Mason.
- Yeah, all mine.

443
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,531
- Come in again sometime.
- Thanks very much. I will.

444
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,909
I mean, yeah.

445
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,334
What do you think you're doing,
holding up traffic?

446
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,341
Well now, what is it, a boy or a girl?

447
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,844
What do you think?

448
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,725
Cut that out, all of you!
You want to wake that baby?

449
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,560
All right, get going!

450
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,777
- Do you like him?
- Sort of.

451
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,279
Don't you think he's just beautiful?

452
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,538
- Jane, don't you think he looks old?
- What do you mean, old?

453
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,666
Don't you think
he looks about six months old...

454
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,000
or a year at least?

455
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,877
Don't be silly, darling.

456
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,380
Don't you think he's just beautiful?

457
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,676
- Hope he grows up to look like you.
- How can he? He has all your features.

458
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,470
I don't see how you can tell that
by looking at that face.

459
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,766
Look at the crinkles around his eyes.
They're just like yours when you're happy.

460
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:49,062
He doesn't look happy, Jane.
He looks kind of bored.

461
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,732
You'd be bored, too,
if you'd been through what he has.

462
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,360
Don't you think he's just beautiful?

463
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,405
Look at that grip.

464
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,661
But don't you think he's just beautiful?

465
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,585
Well, mister, how does it feel
to have your first bath?

466
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,880
Be sure you soap his head thoroughly.
It prevents cradle cap.

467
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,006
I know, Mother.

468
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,968
Little Johnny doesn't want
nasty old cradle cap, does you?

469
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,928
Boy, look at those shoulders.

470
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,559
Jane, can't I do something, please?

471
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,896
Johnny, look what you've done.
I almost dropped him.

472
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,565
- Will you please move over?
- Yeah, all right.

473
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,112
If you'd only let me show you how...

474
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,573
I know how, Mother.
They showed me in the hospital.

475
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,783
You don't rub him dry, you just pat him.

476
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,452
I am patting him.

477
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,834
He looks red. Maybe the water was too hot.

478
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,254
No, it wasn't, Mother. I tested it.
It was just right.

479
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,424
Was the water too hot for little Johnny?

480
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,011
- Johnny, give me his shirt.
- Shirt. Here.

481
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,680
No, not that one. This one.

482
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,685
Boy, look at that chest.
Come on, Jane, can't I help?

483
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,439
- Be careful of his little head, my dear.
- I will.

484
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,733
You'd better go in the kitchen
and warm his milk.

485
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,235
Milk. Okay.

486
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,741
Not too hot, John.

487
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,704
Hallelujah, he's bathed.

488
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,462
- A touch of the colic.
- It isn't, Mother. He's just hungry.

489
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:42,175
I'm sorry, my dear, it's a touch of the
colic. He's been crying for five minutes.

490
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,886
Johnny, where's that bottle?

491
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,644
All right, mister, here you are. Feedbag.

492
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,031
They don't eat with their hands, you dope.

493
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,660
- Here, hold this.
- What do you do there?

494
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,005
I'll get it.

495
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,557
- You see, Mother? He was just hungry.
- If he were fed on time, he wouldn't cry.

496
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,853
- As soon as we're organized...
- It's a pity he has to be fed on the bottle.

497
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,980
I haven't heard the baby complain as yet.

498
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,150
John never saw a bottle
till he was six months old.

499
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,945
I won't say anything.

500
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,157
What's that, my dear?

501
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,868
What do you think?
It's a present from old Granite Puss.

502
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,996
- I'll bet it's a summons.
- No, it's a bank book. Look.

503
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,124
He's deposited $10.

504
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,547
That's a lot of money for the little guy.

505
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,799
Hope it doesn't plunge Doolittle
into bankruptcy.

506
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,969
After that hospital bill, he's got
more cash in the bank than me.

507
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,514
I think it was very considerate of him
to think about the baby's future.

508
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,100
It isn't the future that worries me,
it's the present.

509
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,936
- Where are we gonna put him?
- Why can't he stay in our room?

510
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,980
You know he kept you awake all last night.

511
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,900
You should have considered that
before you rented this flat.

512
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,569
- I know I should have.
- If my own room weren't so small...

513
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,738
No, dear, I wouldn't think of it.

514
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,115
Why can't we keep him in our room
in the daytime...

515
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,700
and in the living room at night?

516
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,495
- It's too far from the bedroom.
- How about the dining room?

517
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,706
It's too near the kitchen,
but I guess it'll have to do.

518
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,251
- Missus?
- Yes, Hilda?

519
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,670
Could I see you for a minute, please?

520
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,131
What is it, Hilda?

521
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,926
Your mother-in-law hired me
when you was away...

522
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,762
but she didn't tell me why you was away.

523
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,306
You mean you don't approve
of my having a baby?

524
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,058
That's your business.

525
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,727
You can have as many babies as you like.

526
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,148
- Thank you. That's big of you.
- But my business is cooking.

527
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,859
You can get somebody else
to wash the diapers.

528
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,030
You're fired!

529
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,078
Johnny, now just don't worry about it.

530
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,042
I wish I could go back to the hospital.

531
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,129
After this lease is up,
I'll get you a house in the country.

532
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,172
You'll have a room all by yourself.

533
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,801
You'll have a garden
where you can ride your bicycle, and I'm...

534
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,766
Mother, come here. Jane, look.

535
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,893
He's smiling at me!

536
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,148
That's gas.

537
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,017
Hello, darling. How was it?

538
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,061
- Swell.
- Who was there?

539
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,482
- Just the same old crowd, 10 years older.
- Who spoke, Johnny?

540
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,277
Ed O'Mally. He made quite a speech...

541
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,323
about how he just bought a seat
on the Stock Exchange.

542
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,453
Joe Kendall, he just came back
from opening a London office.

543
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,830
Did you make a speech?

544
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,500
- Yeah.
- What did you say?

545
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:31,422
You know, just the kind of things you have
to talk about at reunions. Nothing much.

546
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,633
What did you say, honey?

547
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,428
My speech was pretty short.

548
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,141
What did I have to say?

549
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:49,315
- "Man most likely to succeed."
- You still are.

550
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,651
I bet your speech was swell.

551
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,907
Did you tell them that funny story
you told me yesterday?

552
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,743
No. Didn't think of it.

553
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,247
All I could think of was my achievements...

554
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,584
what I've accomplished, how far I've gone.

555
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:12,297
I suppose I could have told them
that I used your money, all of it...

556
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,966
- to buy furniture for this apartment.
- That's silly.

557
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,094
Your money, my money. What difference?
It wasn't much anyway.

558
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,139
I could have told them
that the baby sleeps in the dining room.

559
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,891
What of it? It's only temporary,
till we get another flat.

560
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:28,354
- Because I can't afford to get you a decent...
- Stop that! Don't say those things.

561
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,568
Sometimes I get so mad at you,
I can't see straight.

562
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,447
Sometimes I get so mad at myself,
I can't see at all.

563
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,992
I know what happened. Your dinner
disagreed with you. What did you have?

564
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,245
- I didn't eat anything.
- Now I know what's wrong. You're hungry.

565
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,540
Come on, honey.
I'll get you something out of the icebox.

566
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:55,590
Let's see. There's some cheese you like,
and a whole cold chicken. Which?

567
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,758
Chicken.

568
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,761
Darling, the trouble with you
is you let people step on you.

569
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,388
You do all the work
down in that office. Coffee?

570
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,473
I'll have milk.

571
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,975
You've forgotten more law
than Carter will ever know.

572
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,145
How do you expect people
to recognize your value... White or rye?

573
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,606
- Rye.
- Unless you recognize it yourself?

574
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,610
They couldn't get along without you
for a minute, and everybody knows it.

575
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,863
- Everybody but Doolittle.
- He does, too. He takes advantage of you.

576
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,867
I told you when he promoted Carter
over your head, you should have quit.

577
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,619
How could I do that? What about...

578
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,288
I know, your mother and me.
I wish you'd forget about us.

579
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,498
If I lost my job...

580
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,793
But you wouldn't. They wouldn't let you go.
You're far too valuable.

581
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,713
If you left, Doolittle would crawl on
his hands and knees and beg you to return.

582
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,965
Hands and knees? You don't know Doolittle.

583
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,134
I know you. All you have to do is speak up.

584
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,638
Stand right up to Doolittle.
Don't ask for your rights, demand them.

585
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,103
Remember when I bought you
that ring in Boston...

586
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:54,440
- and promised I'd get you a better one later?
- I don't want a better one later.

587
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,236
You said you liked the platinum one
with the diamonds.

588
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,779
That can wait.

589
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,367
I suppose the mink coat can wait, too?

590
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,956
In about 400 years,
I can afford to buy you one.

591
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,500
- What are you, a man or a mouse?
- A mouse!

592
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,964
You know what's wrong with you? You're
too modest. You don't appreciate yourself.

593
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,925
I do want the platinum ring,
and I want a fur coat.

594
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,679
Not the mink one, but a fur coat.
I want a honeymoon on the Normandie.

595
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,599
I want a place big enough that the baby
won't have to sleep in the dining room.

596
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,686
You can get me everything I want,
everything that's coming to me.

597
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,188
But first you've got to get
what's coming to you!

598
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,566
If I just knew how to go about it.

599
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,317
- It's easy.
- You think it's easy.

600
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,739
- You just walk right into the office and say...
- You don't walk into Doolittle's office.

601
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,408
- He sends for you.
- This time, you're going to walk in.

602
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,659
Go right up to him and say:

603
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,495
"Judge, there's something
I've got to say to you right now."

604
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:53,040
- You can't talk to him like that, though.
- Have you ever tried?

605
00:45:55,586 --> 00:46:00,339
You don't understand.
If I barged in there like that, he'd...

606
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,385
- He'd say, "What is it, Mason? Sit down."
- He's never asked me to sit down.

607
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,972
Then stand up, but don't let him
interrupt you. Speak your piece.

608
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:13,436
"Speak your piece." It's easy to do
here in the kitchen. You get downtown...

609
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,189
Downtown or uptown,
what difference does it make?

610
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,942
You're not asking a favor of him.
You're demanding your rights. He'll listen.

611
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,362
- Make him listen.
- All right, what do I say?

612
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,572
You'll say:

613
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,825
"Judge Doolittle, I've been working for you
for five years now..."

614
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,204
"and I've given you everything
that's in me, every ounce."

615
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,549
- What will he say?
- "There's no doubt about it, Mason."

616
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,594
"I've never questioned your ability
or your loyalty."

617
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,931
- What will I say?
- "What are you going to do about it?"

618
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,641
I hate to think what he'll say.

619
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,810
He'll say,
"Mason, what do you expect me to do?"

620
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,103
You'll say, "Judge
Doolittle, the right thing."

621
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,606
"I want more money,
and to be taken into the firm."

622
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,025
- And he'll say...
- He'll say plenty.

623
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,069
No matter what he'll say, you'll say:

624
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:07,323
"Judge Doolittle, I either get a raise
and a junior partnership..."

625
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:13,621
"or else you can accept my resignation,
effective immediately."

626
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,375
"Effective immediately."

627
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,671
That's all right, Jane.

628
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,968
That's a good idea.
I'll do that some of these days.

629
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,095
"Some of these days" is tomorrow.

630
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,764
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow morning at 10:00.

631
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,394
- Well, if you think I should...
- Darling, there's no time like the present.

632
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,773
Come on, now.
Let's start from the beginning.

633
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,817
I walk into the office, and I say...

634
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,945
"There's something
I've got to say to you right now."

635
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,951
"Either I get a raise
and a junior partnership..."

636
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,664
"or you can accept my resignation."

637
00:47:56,748 --> 00:48:00,751
"Or you can accept my resignation,
effective immediately."

638
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,215
"Effective immediately."

639
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,928
Not bad.

640
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:37,496
I've been working in this office
for the last five years...

641
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,499
and there's something
I want to tell you right now.

642
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:45,463
Either I get a raise and a
junior partnership, or else...

643
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,219
Or else.

644
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,824
A raise and a junior partnership, or...

645
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,118
- Judge Doolittle is in.
- Okay.

646
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:21,290
Or else you can accept my resignation,
effective immediately!

647
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,336
- What is it, a jury case?
- Never mind. I'm thinking.

648
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,005
Here are the papers in City v.
Consolidated.

649
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,549
Drop over to Consolidated
and see their accountants.

650
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,717
Okay.

651
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,682
- Just got in.
- Okay.

652
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,561
Okay.

653
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:16,971
Come in.

654
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:26,188
Judge Doolittle, there's something
I want to say to you right now.

655
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,694
There's...

656
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,742
Judge Doolittle,
I've been working in this office...

657
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,996
It's you. Just the one I want to see.
Sit down.

658
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,710
Thank you, sir.

659
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,336
- Mason.
- Yes, sir?

660
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,506
- You've been doing pretty good work lately.
- Thank you, Judge.

661
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,093
You've been capable, dependable, and loyal,
right from the first.

662
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,763
That's mighty nice of you, Judge.

663
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:03,100
But, Mason, these are extraordinary
times for all of us.

664
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,730
Some of our biggest clients are affected.

665
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:11,108
They all complain they're practically
working for the government.

666
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:15,404
Most of them claim it'll be all they can do
to stay in business till the next election.

667
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,742
So they're cutting expenses right and left.
We're the first to feel it.

668
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,329
- Naturally, we must do something about it.
- Naturally.

669
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,664
- What?
- Naturally.

670
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:31,462
I don't want to cut down the personnel
of my staff, if I can possibly help it.

671
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,839
It wouldn't be constructive.

672
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,802
So the only way out, as I see it,
is to tighten our belts.

673
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,554
I'm asking everyone to take a 25% cut.

674
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:47,269
I'm taking a substantial cut
in my own personal drawing account.

675
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:52,358
It's a sacrifice, but it hits all of us.
And these are days of sacrifice.

676
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,736
Judge, I know, but I have...

677
00:51:55,779 --> 00:52:00,074
In these times, we must all put our
shoulder to the wheel if we are to survive.

678
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,618
Yes, sir. The shoulder to the wheel.

679
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,914
- The only thing is, Judge...
- I'm glad you understand, Mason.

680
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,292
- And I appreciate your cooperation.
- Thank you, sir.

681
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,342
Hello? Excuse me, Mason.

682
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,469
Yes, sir.

683
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,430
Hello, Commissioner.

684
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,391
How are you?

685
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:29,937
Commissioner, you know that
little piece of property up on Park Avenue?

686
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,231
Yes. If the price is right...

687
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,814
- Did you want something, Mr. Mason?
- No, thank you, Lily.

688
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,244
- Well?
- Good morning, Johnny.

689
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,497
Good morning.

690
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,920
- How do you feel?
- I feel fine.

691
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,463
What time is it?

692
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:06,593
3:00. 4:00. 5:00. High noon.

693
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,431
It's 2:00, isn't it?

694
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:14,935
If you know what time it is,
why did you ask me what time it is?

695
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,938
What difference does it make
what time it is, anyway?

696
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,440
I feel fine.

697
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,948
- Feel better now?
- I feel fine.

698
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,369
- Are you comfortable?
- Perfectly comfortable.

699
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,663
Are you sure you're comfortable?

700
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,042
Certainly I'm sure I'm comfortable.

701
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:25,047
Don't you think you'd be more comfortable
if you took your shoes off?

702
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,434
Can I help you?

703
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,271
I can do very nicely by myself, thank you.
I feel fine.

704
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:48,404
What time is it? Am I comfortable?
How do I feel?

705
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,907
You'd think I'd committed
some kind of a crime or something.

706
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,576
You'd think I was on the witness stand.

707
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,203
I can do that.

708
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,254
A man comes home looking for
a little peace and quiet, and what happens?

709
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,717
"Why didn't you call me back?
Why didn't you come home for dinner?"

710
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,303
A million questions, just because a man...

711
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,682
I ran into Judge Doolittle this afternoon
after you saw him.

712
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,028
Johnny, you fool.

713
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,700
What difference does it make whether you
get a raise, a partnership, or anything?

714
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:39,121
I let you down. I'll always let you down.
I'm no good, Jane.

715
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:43,250
Johnny, don't say that.
It was my fault for interfering.

716
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,336
I made you do it, and I'm terribly sorry.

717
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,422
I'll never do it again, never.

718
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,383
We don't need anything.

719
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:55,137
We have each other and the baby,
our beautiful baby.

720
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,098
You're all I have, and all I want.

721
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,602
Please, if you tell me
you feel bad, I'll die.

722
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,813
Johnny, look at me,
and tell me you don't feel bad.

723
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,316
I don't feel bad, Jane.

724
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,193
Jane, I don't feel bad.

725
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,112
Honest I don't. I feel fine.

726
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,994
Johnny, the next time
you go out and get tight...

727
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:22,247
if you don't take me with you,
I'll get a divorce.

728
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:27,419
- You'd better get a good lawyer.
- I've got a good lawyer.

729
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:07,292
Keep coming. Come on, now.

730
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,171
If you want something, you gotta go get it.
That's it. Come on.

731
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,801
Miss Mason,
you should have seen him traveling.

732
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,178
Is you tired?

733
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,265
I've been all over town,
and my head is splitting.

734
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:24,685
Lean back,
and let Lily rub the back of your neck.

735
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,608
Been around visiting, Miss Mason?

736
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:35,195
Does Mr. Mason know
you're looking for a job?

737
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,864
Who said I was looking for a job?

738
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:43,245
Lily, it isn't nice to go prying
into people's affairs.

739
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,333
Excuse me, Miss Mason.

740
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,965
Lily, you must be the 15th woman I've had
working for me since I've been married...

741
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:58,051
and you're too good to be true.
You're worth your weight in gold.

742
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,595
That's a lot of gold.

743
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:03,307
You're the best woman I ever had
in my house, just simply perfect.

744
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,351
That's why it breaks my heart
to have to tell you...

745
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,772
Never you mind, honey.
I knows. I'm a luxury.

746
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,108
I'd never let you go. Never, if I...

747
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,320
Shucks, honey, you ain't getting rid of me.

748
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:19,031
You're just getting me off your budget.

749
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,743
- Is the head better?
- Much better.

750
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,330
I'll make an awful mess of things
without you.

751
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,708
No, you won't.
You'll step right in and do the job.

752
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,460
It's a pretty good job, too.

753
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,463
A whole lot better than you can get
on the outside.

754
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:38,300
Taking care of a nice young man
and a sweet little baby...

755
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,677
and an old lady that's
a little perniskey...

756
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,640
but that's because she's getting along
and don't have nothing to do.

757
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,975
I wish it were as simple as that.

758
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:51,897
Lily's a whole lot older than you are,
honey, and she's done a lot of living.

759
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,232
She learned one thing:

760
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,819
Never let the seeds stop you
from enjoying the watermelon.

761
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,155
That's all right if
you've got a watermelon.

762
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,159
You mustn't say that, Miss Mason.
You've got your watermelon.

763
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,746
But you chokes yourself up
on all them little seeds.

764
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,290
I always say, "Spit them out."

765
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,378
Spit them out
before they spoil your taste for the melon.

766
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,922
Spit them out.

767
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,649
Bless you.

768
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,945
Bless you.

769
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,948
Are you sure
Carter has our telephone number?

770
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,117
If he hasn't,
he certainly has a telephone book.

771
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,994
Then why do you suppose
he hasn't at least called up?

772
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,205
Maybe he forgot all about it.

773
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,667
Mother, a man doesn't invite you
to a New Year's Eve party...

774
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,669
and then just forget about it.

775
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,380
Maybe we should go join him at the party.

776
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,299
Jane, I told you,
I don't know where the party is.

777
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,429
He told me he'd meet us here
in his car at 9:00.

778
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,180
It's almost 11:00 now.

779
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:11,518
Isn't this party also to announce
his engagement to Eunice Doolittle?

780
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,979
I don't know. Something like that.

781
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,398
Perhaps he thought
it would be a little awkward...

782
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,401
to have you and Jane
at his engagement party.

783
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,737
Mother, how could it be awkward?

784
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:25,031
Are we going to sit here all evening
waiting to hear from him?

785
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,616
Let's call him up.

786
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,038
All the same, it might be awkward.

787
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,833
Why should it be awkward?

788
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,511
Hello, operator.

789
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,015
Hello? What's the matter
with this connection?

790
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,225
Operator, I'm calling...

791
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,271
Hello? Is this Mr. Carter's residence?

792
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,982
Is Mr. Carter there?

793
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,112
I see. No, thanks.

794
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:09,659
They say at Carter's house he left
two hours ago. So we can forget about it.

795
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,621
The baby definitely has the sniffles.

796
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:16,833
- All babies have sniffles at this time of year.
- He caught his cold from you.

797
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:21,046
That's simply ridiculous. Matter of fact,
I caught my cold from the baby.

798
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,758
He's had the sniffles all day.
And when I took his temperature...

799
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,802
That's when he caught your cold.

800
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,263
He certainly didn't. He had no temperature.

801
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,683
It isn't anything, Johnny.
It's just the sniffles.

802
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:38,480
I suppose I ought to stay in my room
all day.

803
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,901
Mother, that's silly.
You don't have to do anything of the kind.

804
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:47,280
Heaven knows I try to earn my room and
board by doing everything I can to help.

805
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,866
Mother, please, this is New Year's Eve.

806
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,494
It's just like every other day,
as far as I'm concerned.

807
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,454
You were both perfectly
willing to go off...

808
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,541
and leave me all alone
to wait for the New Year...

809
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,210
when perhaps it's the last New Year
I'll ever see.

810
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,130
Mother, why do you
keep saying things like that?

811
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,508
It's Carter.

812
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,348
- Good evening, Mr. Mason.
- Hello, Lily. How are you?

813
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,642
Happy New Year, Mrs. Mason!

814
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,311
I want to leave this with you.

815
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,356
- Lily, you sweet old thing.
- Thanks a lot, Lily.

816
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,901
It ain't nothing. I had a day off,
cooked up some chicken...

817
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,362
and where I work, they give me the wine.

818
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:32,242
- Happy New Year to you all.
- Happy New Year, Lily. Have a good time.

819
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,702
Goodbye.

820
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,664
That solves everything.

821
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,834
We don't have to go out.
We can stay right here and celebrate.

822
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:44,629
We'll open the wine now, and at
midnight we'll feast on Lily's chicken.

823
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,424
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Let's have fun.

824
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:51,761
You know it always gives me indigestion
to eat just before I go to bed.

825
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,347
Maybe there will be
some left over for me tomorrow.

826
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,183
I never did approve of Lily.
She's much too forward.

827
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:01,062
- But I do miss her cooking.
- That doesn't say much for mine.

828
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:04,816
Well, my dear, you'll learn.
It takes time, of course.

829
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:07,527
I won't say anything.

830
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,575
Times are different now.

831
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:17,913
When I was married, every well-brought-up
girl knew something about cooking.

832
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,415
Jane, what is it?

833
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,793
I can't cook or keep house,
I don't know how to bring up a baby...

834
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,545
I don't know what you're talking about.

835
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,048
You've resented me
from the first moment you saw me...

836
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,467
because you wanted
Johnny to marry Eunice Doolittle.

837
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:34,429
- My dear, I never said anything like that.
- You've hinted at it enough, though.

838
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,182
I did nothing of the sort.
But they were engaged.

839
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,559
Mother, I was never engaged
to Eunice Doolittle.

840
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,020
Not perhaps engaged...

841
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:45,899
And even if I was, you shouldn't
keep talking about it to Jane all the time.

842
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,151
I don't see why she should be
so touchy about it.

843
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,862
- Touchy? That's why you hate me.
- Jane, will you please...

844
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,907
No, let her go on.
She can say anything she likes.

845
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:57,911
I know my place here.
I'm just a guest, an unwelcome guest.

846
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,330
For crying out loud,
what's the matter with you two?

847
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,873
There's nothing the matter with me.

848
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,042
- This is her house.
- This is not my house.

849
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,628
- I do everything I can to help.
- Now, listen...

850
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,881
I'm the stranger around here.
Everything I say and do is wrong.

851
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,593
Just because I mentioned
that John and Eunice Doolittle...

852
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,512
Now stop it, both of you!

853
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,609
See what you made me say to Mother?

854
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,237
- You said it to me, too. Don't I count?
- Yes, of course.

855
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,490
But Mother's old and won't be with us long.
Why can't you get along?

856
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,617
Why can't she get along?
Because she hates me.

857
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,161
You don't know how it is.
You're at the office all day.

858
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,872
Between taking care of the baby,
the house, and cooking...

859
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,960
and listening to her criticize everything
I do, I can't stand it anymore!

860
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,171
You can spit out only so many seeds.

861
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,784
- What?
- Where are you going?

862
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,580
I don't know. Just anywhere
to get away from that wrangling.

863
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,123
Wait a minute.

864
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,049
Don't you want me to go with you?

865
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:37,761
Don't you understand a man
wants to be alone every once in a while?

866
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:42,599
- I'm sorry, Johnny, really I am.
- Jane, you don't have to apologize.

867
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:46,019
Would you rather I didn't come with you?

868
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:51,357
It's all right, Johnny. I don't mind.
You go ahead and have a good time.

869
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:54,694
You can come along if you want to.

870
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:58,740
- You sure you don't mind?
- Of course I don't mind.

871
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:03,578
We'll have a wonderful time.
You just wait and see.

872
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:25,433
Johnny, what's happened to us?

873
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:28,937
I don't know.

874
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,774
Maybe I pulled a dirty trick on you...

875
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,193
when I took the cinder out of your eye
up in Boston.

876
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,653
What do you mean?

877
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:40,782
I mean,
maybe the whole thing has been a mistake.

878
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,327
- What whole thing?
- Our marriage.

879
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:50,959
I've gotten into debt.
I've gotten no place at the office.

880
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:54,879
I've made a household drudge out of you,
just like mother said.

881
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,632
Jane, it just hasn't worked out.

882
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,762
But we haven't had any real trouble.

883
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,141
Maybe a few silly little things...

884
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,435
that all people have to meet
when they get married.

885
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,356
Maybe we shouldn't have had the baby.

886
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,110
Johnny, you can't be sorry about the baby.

887
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,530
I'm crazy about him.
I'm crazy about you, too, Jane.

888
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,532
I'd die for either one of you.

889
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:28,830
Everybody that passes this table looks
at you because you're beautiful and young.

890
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:32,292
- You've got your whole life ahead of you.
- Ahead of us.

891
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:37,964
No. Not when you're dragged down
by a guy who just can't make the grade.

892
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:42,969
I'm not going to hold you
to that kind of a contract.

893
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,308
You ought to know all about contracts.

894
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:59,444
I suppose this is what you call
starting the New Year right.

895
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,907
At least we finally found
something to celebrate.

896
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,287
Happy New Year.

897
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,379
Want to dance?

898
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,624
Happy New Year!

899
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:23,152
I think I'll go phone the house
and wish the baby a Happy New Year.

900
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,575
- A crying jag.
- Happy New Year, Blondie.

901
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,953
Hey, sister, wait a minute.

902
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:46,259
- Hey, lonely heart. What's the matter?
- Happy New Year.

903
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,972
All alone? Come on over and join our party.

904
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,724
Happy New Year.

905
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:56,185
Why are you so sad? Don't you feel good?

906
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,856
- I feel fine.
- Come on, handsome, we got champagne.

907
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,566
Look what I found.

908
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:06,487
A poor little lamb lost in the storm,
alone and neglected.

909
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,699
- Happy New Year.
- Johnny, come quick. The baby.

910
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,995
- The baby?
- Something's the matter with the baby.

911
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,674
Mother, the baby, was that...

912
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,385
- Dr. Healy, what is it?
- Pneumonia.

913
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,491
Dr. Healy.

914
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,827
Come into the office a minute.

915
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,751
Sit down, my boy.

916
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,383
You'd better get your wife.

917
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:12,678
Doctor, if it's bad news, I don't want her
to know about it. She couldn't stand it.

918
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,097
But you can tell me, Doctor.

919
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:18,184
Your baby has Type IX pneumococcus
with a streptococcus complication.

920
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:21,854
And I'm sorry to say
that the congestion is increasing.

921
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:26,401
There's a serum, a new one.
It's worked out in some cases.

922
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,778
Without it, we don't stand a chance.

923
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,323
With it,
perhaps we have a ghost of a chance.

924
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:37,703
We must get some of that serum
as soon as possible. Every hour counts.

925
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:41,082
I don't know whether we can locate
any of it in the city or not.

926
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,751
I'm going to check up on that right away.

927
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:47,922
- Doctor, please don't tell my wife.
- I won't.

928
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,470
Give me the City Health Department.

929
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,099
All the Type IX serum
has been sent to Salt Lake.

930
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,643
Why don't you try
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore?

931
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,938
Sorry, we shipped all we had
for the epidemic in Salt Lake City.

932
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:08,818
Yes, the epidemic is under control here in
Salt Lake. We can spare you six 20 cc vials.

933
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,987
But how will you get it in this storm?

934
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:29,422
- I've got to see Judge Doolittle right away.
- At this hour of the morning?

935
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:31,591
- You've got to wake him up.
- I couldn't do that.

936
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:34,635
You've got to. He knows me.
I work for him. I've got to see him.

937
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,805
I'm sorry, but Judge Doolittle
would never allow me to...

938
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,098
Say, there.

939
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,435
Wait, you mustn't do that.
Where are you going?

940
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,854
You mustn't do this. It's outrageous.

941
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,240
Judge Doolittle.

942
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,578
Come on, wake up.

943
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,290
- I'm sorry to wake you up like this.
- What is it?

944
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:05,833
I've got to talk to you right now.

945
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:09,253
- Are you drunk?
- My kid is in the hospital with pneumonia.

946
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:13,341
You must be drunk, waking me up like this.
It's outrageous. I've never heard of it.

947
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:16,052
- If this is your idea of celebrating...
- Put it on.

948
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:18,179
- Now, you listen to me.
- Now, you listen to me.

949
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:21,807
When you asked me to take that cut,
I didn't beef about it. I should have.

950
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:25,019
Because that's why the baby has to sleep
in the dining room.

951
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,187
What are you talking about?

952
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,397
My baby's in the hospital,
dying of pneumonia.

953
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,442
- What?
- Dying! Can't you understand?

954
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:33,778
- Dying?
- Yes! My baby!

955
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,321
Your baby?

956
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:39,825
Why didn't you get in touch with me before?
I'm terribly sorry to hear this.

957
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,621
I don't need sympathy. I need serum.

958
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:47,250
There isn't any in New York.
There's none anywhere around here.

959
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:50,628
And they finally found some
in Salt Lake City.

960
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,047
It's 2,000 miles away,
and every hour counts.

961
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,258
- Be calm, Mason.
- Be calm? I can't be calm.

962
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:59,262
I can't be calm until I get that serum.
The only way to get it here is to fly it.

963
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,346
Certainly, fly...

964
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:04,100
But there's terrific storms over Utah.
All the planes are grounded.

965
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:10,273
- If there's just one thing that we could do...
- Mason, you must get hold of yourself.

966
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:13,276
I know how you feel,
but you must get hold of yourself.

967
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:14,944
Suppose the planes are all grounded.

968
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,363
They could put it
on one of the fastest trains.

969
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:21,534
No, they can't. I told you, every
hour counts, every minute counts.

970
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,871
We need a plane from Salt Lake City.
We have a plane.

971
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:31,377
But the pilot wants $5,000
to fly it to New York.

972
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,547
I don't know, Judge.

973
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,800
I just didn't have anybody else to turn to.

974
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:40,511
Simon, what are you standing there for?

975
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:44,932
Get my checkbook. And get me a pen, quick.
One that will write.

976
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,226
Find out where
the nearest telegraph office is.

977
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:48,561
Yes, sir.

978
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:52,565
You should have
gotten in touch with me sooner.

979
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:57,320
Don't you worry about that serum. We'll
have it here, and in plenty of time, too.

980
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,089
Yes, Mr. Mason.
The serum's here and the money's here, too.

981
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,091
I could certainly use that kind of dough.

982
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:23,387
But the weather has gotten so bad,
it's impossible to take off, that's all.

983
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,765
What can I do?

984
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,144
I know exactly how you feel.

985
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,605
I'm a married man myself.
I've got a couple of kids.

986
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,649
I've got to think of them.

987
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:41,572
My wife won't let me. She says if I do go,
she won't be here when I get back...

988
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,865
if I get back.

989
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:48,412
- What do you do with a guy like that?
- Let me talk to him.

990
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,123
Listen, what do you think this is,
a suicide club?

991
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:55,086
You can't expect anybody in his right mind
to fly a plane on a night like this...

992
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,547
especially an old crate with whiskers.
Why don't you...

993
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:03,094
Sure, that's tough.

994
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:06,472
We'd certainly like to help you out.

995
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:11,394
Ain't there no other place
you could get some of the stuff?

996
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,648
Maybe in a few hours
when the weather clears up...

997
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,445
Gee, the guy's crying-

998
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:26,409
Now, wait a minute, buddy, take it easy.
Suppose we...

999
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:29,745
Maybe I...

1000
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:32,957
He won't take no for an answer.

1001
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,626
Hold the wire.
Jim, could I borrow your plane?

1002
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,169
- Are you nuts?
- You know how it is.

1003
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,922
You've got kids of your own.
Suppose you were in his place.

1004
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:42,550
I can't let you take my plane.
I couldn't get insurance.

1005
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,635
Hold it a minute. Keep your shirt on.

1006
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,138
I'll give you half the money
if you loan me the crate.

1007
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:48,347
What if you crack up?

1008
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,475
Then you can keep the whole $5,000.
I won't need it.

1009
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:55,271
I think you're crazy,
but all right, if you want to.

1010
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,481
Okay, buddy, relax.

1011
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,826
Think he'll ever get off the ground
with all that gas?

1012
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,494
I did, going to Honolulu.

1013
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,551
I can't say I like that kind of dough...

1014
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:30,264
but it looks to me like
I'm going to be in $5,000 before morning.

1015
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,366
He's all right. He's
holding his own nicely.

1016
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,119
- May I go in and see him?
- You'd better not, just now.

1017
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:53,996
Why don't you want me to see him?

1018
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:57,124
- Please don't worry. It's only...
- Why don't you want me to...

1019
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:01,378
You're lying to me!

1020
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:06,550
You're lying to me. He's worse.
That's why you wanted the oxygen.

1021
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:07,927
Jane, dear, please.

1022
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:11,222
The oxygen is only to help him
until the serum gets here.

1023
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,265
You're lying to me.

1024
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,936
I want you to lie down and rest.
I'll give you something to make you sleep.

1025
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,145
Will you do that for me?

1026
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,565
Dr. Healy, please don't make me.
I couldn't.

1027
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:27,696
I'm sorry. I'm all right.
When can I see him?

1028
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,240
In a little while.

1029
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:42,753
- If the baby dies, I want to die, too.
- I know, dear, but you mustn't feel that way.

1030
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,297
You mustn't let John know
that you feel that way.

1031
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,884
He loves the baby, too,
almost as much as he loves you.

1032
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,806
Poor Johnny.
He'll be so lonely if the baby...

1033
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,892
He'll have you, Jane, and you'll have him.

1034
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:01,313
You can't be lonely, either of you,
as long as you have each other.

1035
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,108
Do you know when you're really lonely?

1036
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,987
It's when you have no one
to share things with, not even a loss.

1037
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:11,115
Mother, you're lonely, aren't you?

1038
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,077
I wasn't always a bitter old woman.
I wasn't always a pest and a nuisance.

1039
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,622
Not when I had someone
to share things with.

1040
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:22,501
And now the baby. My baby's baby.

1041
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:26,547
Mother.

1042
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:06,689
Denver calling Commercial NC-24.
Come in, Conway.

1043
01:23:08,274 --> 01:23:09,566
Come in.

1044
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,195
Can't you read me, Conway?

1045
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:17,866
Can't you read me? Come in, Conway.

1046
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,664
Denver calling Newark.
Do you read me, Newark?

1047
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:28,460
Still can't contact Conway.
Storm increasing over the Rockies. Denver.

1048
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:34,091
Send out an emergency to all stations.
Stand by to contact Conway.

1049
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:37,928
North Platte, Nebraska,
calling Conway Commercial NC-24.

1050
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,013
Do you read me?

1051
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,974
24, this is Omaha. Do you hear me, Conway?

1052
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,685
Chicago calling Commercial NC-24.

1053
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:47,730
Conway, can you read me?
Can't you answer, Conway?

1054
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,744
No, we haven't seen or
heard a plane all day.

1055
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:06,373
Sorry, it's no use sending searching
parties out in this blizzard.

1056
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:35,527
If there was just something I could do...

1057
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,656
If there was just something...

1058
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:42,409
There is.

1059
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:47,164
Will you come with me?

1060
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,506
Sister Madelaine, I'm not a Catholic.

1061
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,716
That doesn't matter.

1062
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:18,529
You know how much he means
to Johnny and me.

1063
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:22,449
We've only had him such a little while.

1064
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:26,328
Dear God, please.

1065
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:30,541
We do want to see him grow up
and be a man.

1066
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:34,795
Please help our little baby.
We love him so.

1067
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,881
He's so small and helpless.

1068
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,634
He can't do anything for himself...

1069
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:43,512
and we can't seem to do anything for him.

1070
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:45,389
Please.

1071
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,699
Shall I order
another tank of oxygen, Doctor?

1072
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:31,119
If the serum isn't here
in another couple of hours...

1073
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,679
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hello, Jane.

1074
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,404
We'll always be together,
no matter what happens.

1075
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,448
Just like this, always.

1076
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,293
Who are you? What do you want?

1077
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:05,130
- I'm hurt. Will you help me?
- Mercy's sakes alive!

1078
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:08,300
- What is it? What's happened?
- Never mind that.

1079
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:14,765
- What place is this?
- Liberty Corners.

1080
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:18,018
- Where's that?
- 35 miles from New York.

1081
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,023
For mercy's sakes alive!

1082
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,992
"St. Francis Hospital, New York City."

1083
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,203
"Rush."

1084
01:29:47,256 --> 01:29:48,465
Hello?

1085
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:51,718
Operator?

1086
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:56,348
I want the St. Francis Hospital.
New York City.

1087
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,686
And reverse the charges.

1088
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,346
Happy New Year, darling.

1089
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:43,562
Happy New Year.

1090
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:53,488
Gentlemen, I guess four is about enough
on a business day.

1091
01:30:53,573 --> 01:30:57,492
That's all very good, Joe,
but ain't it about time you bought one?

1092
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,286
What's that?

1093
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:03,165
Conway calling Doolittle.

1094
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:07,544
And there are certain things, gentlemen,
that I want distinctly understood.

1095
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:09,838
I called this meeting
of all the partners...

1096
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,757
in order to make my position clear
once and for all.

1097
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:16,136
That before I accept
your offer of partnership...

1098
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:18,930
in the firm of Doolittle, Messerschmidt...

1099
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:22,684
Doolittle, Hutch, and Carter...

1100
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:27,355
you must know that I consider the methods
of this firm at the present time...

1101
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,150
old-fashioned, self-satisfied...

1102
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:33,195
high-handed, and thoroughly inefficient.

1103
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,363
- It's seems to me...
- Quiet.

1104
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:42,037
And I demand that they be changed,
effective immediately.

1105
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:47,042
Come in.

1106
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:50,045
Excuse me. I hope we haven't interrupted
anything important.

1107
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:52,422
Johnny, I know Judge Doolittle won't mind.

1108
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:55,800
We just couldn't wait. We had to rush down
the moment it happened.

1109
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:57,219
What happened?

1110
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:59,012
The baby can talk.

1111
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:00,472
- No.
- Yeah.

1112
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:01,890
No.

1113
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:06,603
They don't believe us.
Come on, darling, let's prove it to them.

1114
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,356
Show them. Don't be afraid.
Speak up. Say "daddy."

1115
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:12,067
Come on, darling, say "daddy."

1116
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:15,904
Come on. Speak up, don't be afraid.
Say "daddy."

1117
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:19,824
Say "daddy."

1118
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,998
Say "daddy."

1119
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:33,505
Come on, Johnny. Say "daddy."

1120
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:34,881
Mama.

1121
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,049
What?

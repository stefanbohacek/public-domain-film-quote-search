1
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,080
# I dream of not a ray of sun 

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,120
# A moment 

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,920
# And then the empty dawn 

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,800
# Awakens the lonely heart broken 

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,600
# A warm embrace 

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,840
# A fleeting smile 

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,880
# A whisper 

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,120
# And then the dream has gone 

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,560
# With most of the words left unspoken 

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,760
# Each lonely day when I awaken 

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,640
# I could not face the empty dawn 

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,680
# For I know 

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,000
# That my heart has been forsaken 

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,800
# A dream of love was all I knew 

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,040
# That moment before the empty dawn 

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:39,920
# Awakened my lonely heart broken... # 

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,560
DOOR CREAKS 

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Tequila. 

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
- Is he having a dance? 
- Five-ace card player. 

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,320
STRUGGLES FOR BREATH 

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,080
Five dollars he doesn't last another minute. 

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,200
- Cut him down. 
- You stay out of this, Yank. We'll cut him down when he quits kicking. 

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,960
Ugh! 

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,920
Billy... Get in, boy! 

25
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,280
LAUGHTER 

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,600
GUNSHOT 

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,720
LAUGHTER CONTINUES 

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,880
Where have you been, Billy? 

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,840
GUNSHOTS 

30
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,720
- You'd better ride with us. 
- There ain't no Yellowleg Yankee boy goin' with us! 

31
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,840
I hear they got a new bank and an old marshal over at Gila City. 

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,400
- That beats cheatin' at cards, don't it?
- Let's go. 

33
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,760
The town looks quiet. 

34
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, I bet the marshal's asleep. 

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,480
Ever shoot a man in his sleep, Yellowlegs? You bein' a Yankee? 

36
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,800
He ain't very sociable, is he? Been with us a week and ain't lost his temper once. 

37
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,720
- I never did trust a man who didn't lose his temper. Let's go. 
- We ain't takin' the bank today. 

38
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,560
- Are you givin' the orders now? 
- Looks that way, don't it? 

39
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,720
- Billy, get him in the back. 
- No, Turkey, that ain't my style. 

40
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,880
Come on, he's askin' for it, boy. 

41
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,720
Any man that'd turn his back on you is just a dag blam fool. 

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,200
I kinda like him. 

43
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,680
I never knowed a Yankee before. 

44
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,040
PLAYS MOURNFUL TUNE 

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,880
Hey, Mead! THEY CHANT TAUNTINGLY 

46
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,840
CONTINUES PLAYING TUNE 

47
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,000
CHILDREN LAUGHING 

48
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,960
Your horse needs a shoe. 

49
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,000
There's a blacksmith's shop. 

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,040
- How long do you figure that money's gonna keep?
- Till I tell you when. 

51
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,440
- I'm kinda anxious to get my hands on it.
- Take care of your horse first. 

52
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,880
I was figurin' on havin' a couple of drinks with you fellas. 

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,440
I sure hope this town has some pretty girls in it. 

54
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
When you get this far out in the brush, they're all pretty. 

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,720
Billy, take the horses round to the livery stables. 

56
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,760
Uh... 

57
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,200
Are you talkin' to me? 

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,200
Your name's Billy, ain't it? 

59
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,200
I'll take the horses for you, mister. 

60
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,320
Well, you look like an honest man. 

61
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,880
You know, some folks is just born lucky, I guess. 

62
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,840
Doggone it, you know, don't push yours! 

63
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,640
What's going on here? 

64
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,960
These don't look too pretty to me. 

65
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I told you, you ain't been out here long enough. 

66
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
Hey! 

67
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,320
Hey, hey, wait a minute. Put that thing back up. 

68
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,800
- That'll have to wait, gents. 
- Wait? Wait for what? 

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,560
Church is about to start. The parson don't like to look at it during his sermon. 

70
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,480
- This ain't Sunday, is it?
- That's a matter of opinion in Gila City. 

71
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,360
We haven't seen a calendar in two years. Some folks hold it's Monday, but these folks hold it's Sunday. 

72
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,200
- Are you gents lookin' for a drink? 
- I'm lookin' right at it. What's in that bottle? 

73
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,440
- Best we've got. Even the Mayor drinks it.
- That'll have to do. 

74
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,600
- Tell me somethin'. How about the bank?
- The bank's open. They're Monday folks. 

75
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,440
The bar's closed when the parson walks in. 

76
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
Howdy, mister! 

77
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
Hello, boy. 

78
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,240
Hey, that's what I call pretty. 

79
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,800
- Who's she, the redhead?
- Works over at the dance hall across the street. 

80
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,840
Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable and bringin' her woods colt with her! 

81
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,680
- Imagine!
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again. 

82
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,520
- Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson. 

83
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,040
And her holding a prayer book like she was respectable! 

84
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,840
If they're going to heaven, let's you and me not go! 

85
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,280
Gents, the bar is closed. 

86
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,320
Number 23. 

87
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,720
# Rock of ages, cleft for me 

88
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,480
# Let me hide myself in thee 

89
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
# Let the water and the blood 

90
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,400
# From thy wounded side which flowed 

91
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,920
# Be of sin the double cure 

92
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,400
# Save from wrath and make me pure 

93
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,880
# Could my tears forever flow 

94
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,280
# Could my zeal no languor know 

95
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,880
# All for sin could not atone... # 

96
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,400
- What are y'all drinkin'? 
- No drinkin'. The bar's closed on account of the church meeting. 

97
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,040
- Whisky. - I told them the bar's... 

98
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,520
Billy, show 'em those six-shooters! 

99
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,840
See how fast you can take the cork out of that bottle. 

100
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,360
I wanna tell you somethin'. He's fast with them six-shooters. This boy's a real comin' boy. 

101
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,400
I taught him everythin' I know. 

102
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,440
- What's the matter?
- You'll have to stand and look at that bottle all the way through the sermon. 

103
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,200
# Let me hide myself in thee... # 

104
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,680
Lord, I see you sent us some new faces today. 

105
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,640
Male... 

106
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,160
and female. 

107
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,400
Lord, I thank you, 

108
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,360
and folks, I welcome you. 

109
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,280
And I'll be dishin' out the gospels in a minute. 

110
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,960
But first, I've got to say a word to you gents with your hats on. 

111
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,840
This here is a preach-house, gents, and you'll take your hats off to the Lord. 

112
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,880
Mister, I never met a man who wouldn't take off his hat to the Lord. 

113
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,920
Let's get it off. 

114
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,240
You get on with your preachin'. 

115
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,440
- He's touchy about that hat. 
- I've never seen nothin' like it. He don't even take it off to sleep. 

116
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,720
We'll have a moment of silent prayer. 

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes... 

118
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,280
All that money just sittin' out there across the street. 

119
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,480
I've never known a man so hungry for money. I think you're studyin' up to be a miser. 

120
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,720
Studyin' up to buy us an army. Don't you remember? 

121
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,760
- Still dreamin' about that? 
- It ain't such a dream. 

122
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,800
We could set up our own republic on this country. It's wide open. Nobody can stop us. 

123
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,280
Take that bank money and the Comancheros will sell us 100, maybe 200 slave Indians. 

124
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,320
We put uniforms on 'em. 

125
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,360
Yeah, fix us up an army. 

126
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,400
And I could drill 'em. 

127
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,360
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hooray, hooray 

128
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,240
# When Johnny comes marching home again... # 

129
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,680
Left face, right face... 

130
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,600
# Johnny comes marching... # 

131
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,200
Mm-hm. 

132
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,240
Raise this arm. 

133
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,280
Raise it. Higher. 

134
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,160
Mm-hm. All right. 

135
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,240
- Has it always pained you that way? 
- Almost always. 

136
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,640
That ball ought to come out of there. 

137
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,680
That's what I'm here for. 

138
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,880
- Have you ever been in Springfield, Ohio?
- No. 

139
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,080
I'll swear I've seen you someplace before. 

140
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,720
Here... 

141
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,000
How long will this lay me up? 

142
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,840
- It's pretty close to the collarbone. A thing like that won't heal overnight, you know.
- What, a week? 

143
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,160
More like a month. 

144
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,280
Well, I got a little business to attend to. 

145
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,480
I don't think it can wait that long. 

146
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Then stop wasting my time. 

147
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,520
Wait a minute. 

148
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,560
Missoura. That's where it was. 

149
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,520
A fella just about your size, Yellowleg sergeant. 

150
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Somebody had tried to scalp him. A liquored-up Johnny Reb with a Bowie knife. 

151
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,720
He cut the sergeant up pretty badly before he was scared off by something. 

152
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,560
You know, if you take off your hat, you could make me out a liar. 

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,480
It's you, all right. 

154
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,160
You certainly went out of your way to look me up, didn't you? Take off the hat. 

155
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,360
I've kind of got used to keeping it on. 

156
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,880
Why? You haven't got anything to hide but a few battle scars. A lot of the boys came out with worse than that. 

157
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
- What did you do after the war ended? 
- What would YOU do? 

158
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,760
- I'd go after that Reb. 
- Well, I found him. 

159
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,800
Is that Reb in town? 

160
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,240
Well, what are you waiting for? 

161
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,280
I'm waiting to get him alone. 

162
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,320
You see, I want him to know who I am. 

163
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,640
I want him to know he's gonna get what he gave me. 

164
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,800
Are you sure you found the right man? 

165
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,400
Yeah, I'm sure. I left my teeth marks in his scalping hand. 

166
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,240
And I'm askin' you, my friends... 

167
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,760
Any man, woman or child that reckons that he wants to go to hell, 

168
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,240
I say let that man, woman or child stand up and be counted! 

169
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,160
What? 

170
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,880
Start countin', Parson. Get up, Turk. 

171
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,400
You white-livered coyote, you're saying you intend to go to that place? 

172
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,440
I sure do, Parson. I'll tell you somethin' else. 

173
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,200
Any man that don't get on his feet right now and join me is goin' there pronto! 

174
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,920
GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMING 

175
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,440
Well, nice to meet you, ma'am. My name's Billy. Billy Keplinger. 

176
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Get out! 

177
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,560
GASPS AND SCREAMS 

178
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,760
Come on, Turkey! 

179
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,400
Sure is a pretty girl. 

180
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,120
Ma'am, I want to thank you for your fortitude. 

181
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,080
We'll all close with a prayer now 

182
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,000
for those poor, misguided men. 

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,640
All that money just sittin' there, waitin' on a Yellowlegged Yankee. 

184
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,040
I never saw a man so patient about robbin' a bank! 

185
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,080
Oh, church meeting's over. 

186
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,640
You have a nice afternoon. 

187
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
Thank you again, ma'am. 

188
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,440
STARTS PLAYING MOURNFUL TUNE 

189
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,600
Let me know when that Yankee's patience runs out. 

190
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,000
If his patience ever does wear out. 

191
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,600
That pretty redhead that just went in holds that today is Sunday. 

192
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,680
What do you lovely creatures feel about that? 

193
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,080
I think it's Monday. 

194
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,200
- Get your horse.
- Huh? 

195
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,080
Get it. 

196
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Billy! 

197
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,480
Hey, Billy! Yellowleg's ready. 

198
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,440
GUNSHOTS 

199
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
SHOUTING AND GUNSHOTS 

200
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,640
Somethin' wrong with that Yankee's shootin' arm. 

201
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,400
Somebody get the doc. 

202
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,080
He's dead. 

203
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,720
It was them outlaws, Kit. They did some wild shootin'. 

204
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,840
No. 

205
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,960
It was me. 

206
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,400
- 'Is she the dance hall woman? 
- That's her. 

207
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,440
'Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable, bringin' her woods colt with her! 

208
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,320
- 'Imagine!
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again. 

209
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
- 'Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson. 

210
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,360
'And her holding the prayer book like she was respectable!' 

211
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,920
That Yellowleg sure has been tryin' to get hisself drunk. 

212
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,040
He ain't quite makin' it though. 

213
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,680
Some men are like that. Give me two. 

214
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,000
The boy's leanin' awful hard on him. 

215
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,040
You reckon the Mayor will be able to talk that redhead into changin' her mind? 

216
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,280
Ain't nothin' gonna change her mind. 

217
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,920
She got Doc Acton to take care of the body and rented herself a wagon. She's goin' tonight. 

218
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,200
Goin' alone if she has to. 

219
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,000
We've come to change your mind, Kit. 

220
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,920
We've decided to have a nice funeral for the boy in Gila City. 

221
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
The whole town will come. As Mayor, I'll see to it. 

222
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,800
Mead will be buried in Siringo next to his father. 

223
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,240
Now, Kit... 

224
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,920
Bury him here? You think I haven't heard all the whispering? 

225
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,920
- You and your gossiping little wives with their pinched little faces and their noses in the air!
- Miss Kit... 

226
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,960
"That dance hall woman with her freckle-faced woods colt. 

227
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,480
"No telling who the father might be!" 

228
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,040
They smell brimstone every time I walk by. 

229
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,560
They hated us both, me and the boy. 

230
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,600
Well, he's dead now 

231
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,880
and you can tell your wives that there was no sinning 

232
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,000
and there'll be no funeral. 

233
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm taking him to Siringo. 

234
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,400
You can't do that. It's smack in the middle of Apache country and there ain't nobody willing to go with you. 

235
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,720
Besides, there's not much of it left but the weeds. 

236
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,760
I've tried, Kit. I've asked everybody. 

237
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,680
I'm not asking anybody to go with me. 

238
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,720
Poor Kit. She's trying mighty hard to make folk believe about the boy's pa. 

239
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,720
- Are you a single man?
- Married. 
- I didn't know that, Cal. 

240
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,760
Well, almost married. 

241
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Me and Emma. She wouldn't let me go with Kit. Not that way. 

242
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,040
Not to mention the Apaches. 

243
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,280
I ain't never seen a town so full of cowards. 

244
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,440
I ain't never seen a town so scared of Indians. 

245
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,480
TURK CHUCKLES 

246
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,520
You can take three. 

247
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,240
Kit? 

248
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,840
I hate to think what all that sun will do to your face. 

249
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,880
Will you take this? 

250
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,920
No, thanks, Cal. 

251
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,440
Take it. I've got no use for it. I can't sell it. 

252
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,880
Imported all the way from St Louis. 

253
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,800
Get down from there! 

254
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,000
I said get down! 

255
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,320
- Somebody's got to drive this for you.
- Not you. 

256
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
I'm askin' to. 

257
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,520
I said get down! 

258
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,560
Need any help, ma'am? 

259
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,640
- Get out of here, Billy. 
- I didn't mean to butt in... 

260
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,680
Your place. 

261
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,040
Get down. 

262
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,680
I bet she don't get 20 miles before she turns around. 

263
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,720
50 dollars. 

264
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,640
And a call. 

265
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,680
What have you got? 

266
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,000
You lose to four aces. 

267
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,640
- We're leaving town.
- You're a little premature, Yellowleg. 

268
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,920
Get your horses. 

269
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:23,600
Billy and me like this town. We're stickin' around. You'd better leave alone cos we ain't leavin'. 

270
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,360
It wasn't me that shot that boy. 

271
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,800
Get up. Get up! 

272
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,520
Looks like you and me is gonna go to Siringo. 

273
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,560
Billy, you and I ain't leavin' here. 

274
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,400
I'm just backin' him up. 

275
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,640
Yeah, I kinda like the idea of going to Siringo with that redhead. 

276
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,080
Come on. What's the matter? 

277
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,920
Come on! 

278
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,360
I guess you don't mind the Yellowleg orderin' you around, but I don't like it. 

279
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,200
But if I could handle that six-shooter like you, Billy boy... 

280
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,240
His back's pointin' right at ya. What's the matter? Scared? 

281
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,880
Scared he might hear your gun comin' out of the holster? 

282
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,120
That ain't no fit way to kill a man. 

283
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,720
Not even a Yankee. 

284
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,360
There she is. 

285
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,880
Yah! Yah! 

286
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,360
- Good morning, ma'am.
- You'll kill your horse pushin' him like that. 

287
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,640
- Will you let me drive that wagon for you?
- I don't want YOUR help! 

288
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,200
Well, I'd be mighty proud to ride in that wagon with you, ma'am. 

289
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,560
Leave me alone! 

290
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Both of you. 

291
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,800
Well, now, you know it ain't exactly safe out here for a woman? 

292
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,840
Well, it ain't exactly safe for you either. 

293
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,600
Any of you. Now git! 

294
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,120
Why don't you leave this woman be and let's head back? 

295
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,800
Yaah! 

296
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,560
Listen, that bank is probably just now opening up. 

297
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,880
Yeah, it probably is, probably is. 

298
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,120
We'll follow along and see she gets through. 

299
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,240
Turkey, that's a woman! 

300
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,280
Come on, let's go. 

301
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Your dress is kinda wet. I guess you're gonna have to dry it out. 

302
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,360
It shouldn't take long in this heat. 

303
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,320
I never did see a dance-hall girl so touchy about gettin' kissed. 

304
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
You stay away from me. 

305
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,560
What will you do with that rock? Use it on me? 

306
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,800
Or a shotgun if I have to! 

307
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,400
Well, ma'am, I always did go for high stakes. 

308
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,680
Apaches. 

309
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,120
They scalped him. 

310
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,760
Yeah. It looks like they did. 

311
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Come on, let's get back to that wagon. 

312
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,560
Hey, the coffee's ready! 

313
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,240
It's plain to see that woman don't want us round here, so why don't we accommodate her by leaving? 

314
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,560
Did you desert? 

315
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,800
- Hmm? 
- Did you desert the Rebel Army? 

316
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,840
I don't remember telling you I was in the army. 

317
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,400
I figured you for a deserter. 

318
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,040
How did you guess? 

319
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,600
Maybe I ought to take her a cup of coffee before it gets cold. 

320
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,680
Leave her alone. 

321
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,960
Are you... Are you talkin' to me? 

322
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,720
Hey, Billy, I think Yellowleg's kinda taken a shine to that woman. 

323
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,840
- And we thought he was feelin' sorry about that boy.
- Shut up! 

324
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,240
- Touchy too.
- Yeah. 

325
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,600
Like he is about that hat he keeps wearin'. 

326
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,960
- You know what I think he's got under it?
- What's that? 

327
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,720
Money. 

328
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,920
Well, there's one way we could find out. 

329
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,120
We can ask him... 

330
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,560
Take your hat off, Yellowlegs. 

331
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,280
He's scared of you, Billy. 

332
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,160
Yellowlegs... 

333
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,320
Take your hat off or I'll shoot it off. 

334
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,240
You try it and I'll kill you. 

335
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,160
BILLY LAUGHS 

336
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,120
Yellowlegs, there's something about you I just gotta like. 

337
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,280
Better mind your thinkin', kid. Yellowleg has done got his claim staked out. 

338
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,720
We could go back to that bank. That posse would never follow us out here, not to Siringo. 

339
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,280
We could set up our own little republic like that Edward fella did down in Texas. 

340
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,600
You know, the republic of Freedonia? 

341
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,040
All this land out here, just a-waitin'. Think how you'd look in a gold braid uniform! 

342
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,840
You're the kind of trigger-happy young fella I can use. 

343
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,880
I'd make you my military aide. 

344
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,720
Then we'd start makin' up a lot of laws, but not one of them would apply to us. 

345
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,760
- They don't now. They never did. 
- There's money in a thing like this. 

346
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,320
If it's run right. But we've got to start first with that bank back in Gila City. 

347
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Turkey, don't you ever shut up? You nag like an old woman! 

348
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,280
It's sure quiet out here, isn't it? 

349
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,040
I don't blame you for feelin' the way you do, 

350
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,760
but right now, it might be a good idea if you could make out like we were getting along. 

351
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,560
Are you always that stubborn or just hard to figure out? 

352
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,520
Lady... 

353
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm just tryin' to help. 

354
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,280
Who are you trying to help? 

355
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,200
Riding shotgun on this wagon isn't going to buy you a clean conscience! 

356
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever figured on going to Siringo at all. 

357
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,240
What are you trying to say? 

358
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,760
I mean, right here is as good as Siringo for the boy. 

359
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,560
You don't have to prove anything to me. 

360
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,440
Damn you! 

361
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,560
- Look at 'em fightin'!
- Yeah. 

362
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,200
You don't know me well enough to hate me that much. 

363
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,200
Hating is a subject I know a little something about. 

364
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,640
You've got to be careful it don't bite you back. 

365
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,680
I know somebody who spent five years looking for a man he hated. 

366
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,520
Hating and wanting revenge was all that kept him alive. 

367
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,320
He spent all them years tracking that other man down, 

368
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,160
and when he caught up with him, it was the worst day in his life. 

369
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,560
He'd get his revenge all right, 

370
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,200
but then he'd lose the one thing he had to live for. 

371
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
GUNSHOT 

372
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,160
- What was that for? 
- I was just checking my aim. 

373
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,520
Nothing like letting the Apaches know where we are! 

374
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,480
That ain't no fit way to kill a man, not even a Yankee. 

375
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,040
You go on up ahead and find us a place to camp. 

376
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,200
- There might be some Apaches out there.
- Then you go find out. 

377
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,680
You know, you could get the sun here. 

378
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,960
I'll get used to it. 

379
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,120
We'll be leaving you in Siringo. You can find your own way back. 

380
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,600
DISTANT HOWLS 

381
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,960
Come on. 

382
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,520
Turk, what are you doin' out here? This ain't your guard. 

383
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,720
I want to show you somethin'. 

384
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,040
I've been carryin' this around with me for a long while. 

385
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,040
- What's that? 
- It's a genuine general's cap. 

386
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,920
I stole it over at San Antonio. I never did show it to anybody before. 

387
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,240
A man sure really looks like something wearin' one of these, don't he, boy? 

388
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,560
Huh? 

389
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,920
If you're waitin' for me to salute you, you're gonna wait a long time. 

390
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,640
Here, I want to show you something else. 

391
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,720
Here... Come here. 

392
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,760
See that part right there? 

393
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,600
It's not on a regular map. A valley. Not many people know it's there. 

394
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,640
We're gonna buy ourselves some slave Indians. We're gonna put uniforms on and we're gonna fill 'em good. 

395
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,760
We'll be able to burn a fire path through this country from Tucson to Tucumcari. 

396
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,040
What do you say, boy? Huh? 

397
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
What do you say to that, huh? 

398
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,680
Fine, Turk, fine. 

399
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,440
Um... 

400
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,840
Take over my guard for me, will you? 

401
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,400
I never travelled with a lady before. 

402
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,600
It kinda appeals to me. 

403
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,160
- Get out of my way. 
- Maybe I will and maybe I won't. 

404
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,000
I'm telling you to leave me alone. 

405
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,600
I don't wanna... I don't wanna trouble you, Kit. 

406
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,640
I just wanna be sociable. 

407
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,240
And I never wear my guns when I make a social call. 

408
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,560
I always did like pretty things and... 

409
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,400
You're just about the prettiest I've ever seen. 

410
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,840
HE LAUGHS 

411
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,560
Saddle up. 

412
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,880
Come on, get out of here. 

413
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,000
- I'm goin' with you, Billy. 
- You ain't goin' no place.
- Huh? 
- You're stayin' right here. 

414
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,040
- He wouldn't stand a chance in Apache country alone.
- That's his lookout. 

415
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,840
COYOTE HOWLS 

416
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,600
Turk! 

417
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,840
He's gone. 

418
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:39,680
- They'll be going back to Gila City, both of them. I'll drive you back if you want.
- No, thanks. 

419
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,880
You still going to Siringo? 

420
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,040
- You think you can stop me? 
- Lady, I wouldn't even try. 

421
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,000
Aaaiee! 

422
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,240
I, uh... 

423
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,200
I'm sorry about losing the horse. 

424
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,200
- Well, you don't have to talk to me, you know!
- It ain't worth the effort. 

425
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,360
Five years is a long time to turn your back on, especially for a woman like me. That's what you think. 

426
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,800
- Lady, I quit thinking when I turned my horse around.
- Stop calling me Lady! My name is Kit. 

427
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,120
- I don't know you well enough! 
- Don't think you're fooling me. 

428
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,160
You're not half as mad at me as you are at yourself. 

429
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,040
Gonna talk all the way to Siringo? 

430
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,600
Ha! 

431
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,000
GUNFIRE AND WAR CRIES 

432
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,520
Grab that shotgun! Come on! 

433
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,680
GUNFIRE CONTINUES 

434
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,360
Must have ambushed that stage down at the border. 

435
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,760
YELLING AND WHOOPING 

436
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,040
I sure wish I could take a bath. 

437
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,160
Well, nothing's stopping you. 

438
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,920
Come on. 

439
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,240
Want some more? 

440
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,760
You know...I can hardly remember what my husband looked like. 

441
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,880
We were only married a few weeks. We were on our way to Gila City when he was... 

442
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,680
..he was killed in Siringo. 

443
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,440
When Mead was born, they wouldn't believe me. 

444
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,240
Gila City put a brand on both of us. 

445
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,720
With their...jokes and their...talk 

446
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,960
and their ugly little smiles. 

447
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,520
Getting dark. 

448
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,160
We've got to have another horse. 

449
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,600
Them Apaches can't be far off. They've got plenty of horses. 

450
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,240
You wait right here until I get back. 

451
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,480
SHOUTS AND CONFUSION 

452
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,560
CONTINUES FIRING 

453
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,880
Whoa. 

454
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,800
Kit! 

455
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,840
Pack up. We're moving out. 

456
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,240
Whoa. 

457
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,440
That's far enough. 

458
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,280
I don't think I can stay awake another minute. 

459
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,320
You'll have to. 

460
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,240
Start digging. 

461
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,760
- What?! 
- We're going to bury the wagon. 

462
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:37,000
Our trail's got to look Indian. If we're lucky, those Apaches are still trying to find their stagecoach. 

463
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,920
Getting tired? 

464
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,360
I didn't ask for any help. 

465
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,440
I wasn't offering any. I just asked if you were getting tired. 

466
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,800
Is Yellowleg a name? 

467
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,240
Well, it'll do. 

468
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,800
- Where are you from?
- Ohio. 

469
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,640
Is it pretty back there? 

470
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,680
Used to be. 

471
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,720
What are you doing? 

472
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,560
Do and I'll kill you. 

473
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,320
What is it? 

474
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,640
Apache. 

475
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,120
- How could he miss?
- He didn't. 

476
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,680
Well, why didn't he kill us? 

477
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,720
He's got a little score to settle up with me first. 

478
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,240
Start packing up. 

479
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,200
- Can't forgive me for making you give up those five years, can you? 
- I'll pick up his trail again. 

480
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,240
Hardly seemed worth the trouble. 

481
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,520
HORSE STIRS 

482
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,280
There you go. 

483
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,800
RATTLESNAKE HISSES 

484
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,160
He broke it. 

485
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
SINGLE SHOT 

486
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,560
What is he waiting for? Why doesn't he kill us? 

487
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,160
He will when he's ready. 

488
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,120
- Why don't you kill us and get it over with?! Come on!
- Stop it! 

489
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,880
- Leave me alone!
- Shut up!
- Why do you let him torture us?
- Shut up! 

490
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,840
Our Apache friend's been awful quiet. Maybe he got bit by a snake. 

491
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:53,040
- Do you think it's much further? 
- What?
- Siringo. 

492
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,840
- Siringo what?
- Do you think...? 

493
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,440
Strange. 

494
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,840
I feel I know you better than any man I've ever known. 

495
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,440
Yet I hardly know you at all. 

496
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,880
- What are you trying to do? 
- You're hurting me! 
- What did you expect to find? 

497
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,080
I was only trying to make you more comfortable. 

498
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,360
I'm sorry. 

499
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,840
HORSE WHINNIES 

500
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,640
Sorry... 

501
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,040
There's...some things about me you don't understand. 

502
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,680
You killed the only person I loved in this whole world. 

503
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,800
That's all I need to know about YOU. 

504
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,040
Next time I'll be waiting for him. 

505
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,880
Inside. 

506
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,800
Go on. 

507
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,680
This'll do. 

508
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,680
Here. 

509
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,280
You've got enough buckshot in there to stop an army. 

510
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,120
He ought to be on top of the bluff by sundown, so I'll wait for him. 

511
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,720
If I'm not back by morning, you're on your own. 

512
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,160
Wait. 

513
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,400
I...just wanted to say... 

514
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,040
..thank you. 

515
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,960
RUMBLE OF THUNDER 

516
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,440
THUNDER GROWS LOUDER 

517
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,840
- Aaaiee!
- Ungh! 

518
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,000
Aaargh! 

519
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,680
Where is it? By the mission? 

520
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,720
What was your husband's name? 

521
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,000
Mead Tildon. My son was named after him. 

522
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,040
I couldn't find it. 

523
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,760
It's there. 

524
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:18,360
No, there ain't nobody named Tildon buried there. 

525
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,000
You're just the same as all the rest of them. 

526
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,640
Here it is. 

527
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,240
It must be one of the others. 

528
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,040
Kit! 

529
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,320
Kit! I found it! 

530
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,240
I found it. 

531
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,080
Yellowleg. 

532
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,520
- Where's Turk? 
- Right behind you. 

533
01:15:53,520 --> 01:16:00,280
When Billy gets hold of an idea, he just won't let go of it. Especially a red-headed woman. 

534
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,240
Well, there's no need to keep the lady out here in the sunshine. 

535
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,080
Let's step inside and talk things over. 

536
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,840
Sorry I can't offer you folks a drink. 

537
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,880
- What did you do with the money? 
- Money? What money? 

538
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:04,120
- Only one thing would bring him down here - keeping ahead of a posse.
- I never saw folks so scared of Injuns. 

539
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,640
I tell you, she sure is pretty. 

540
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,480
Turkey, go get that money. 

541
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,760
- Are you crazy?
- Go on. Do what I told you to do. 

542
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,480
- You know, I...I just ain't got the heart to kill him.
- Huh? 

543
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,760
How would you like to have your gun back? 

544
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,640
- You want me to do it? 
- I'll be much obliged. 

545
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:01,360
- Just the minute he walks back through this door.
- What about her? 

546
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,080
We'll decide that later. You and me. 

547
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:18,040
Well, I'm going for a little walk. I'll be around. 

548
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,800
The lady's got to admit I got guts. 

549
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,080
You'd better get out of here. 

550
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:44,680
- You can't! 
- I've waited five years. The waiting is over. Now keep out of it. 

551
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:48,720
What happened to Mead was an accident. I know that now, 

552
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:52,760
even though I thought that I could never forgive you for it. 

553
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,560
But I could never love a man who was a cold-blooded killer. 

554
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,120
Love? 

555
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,440
You don't even know me. 

556
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,080
I'm a face under a hat. 

557
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,440
Ever wonder why I won't take this off? 

558
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:26,280
- Want to talk about love? 
- I've seen you with your hat off. 

559
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,160
What about MY scars? 

560
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:19,200
Do you know how many men I've let kiss me just because their filthy money gave them the right? 

561
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,000
Men with dirty shirts, 

562
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,040
smelly arms, money in their pockets. 

563
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,040
Can those scars be forgotten? 

564
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,320
Can I ask you to love a... 

565
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,840
..a woman like that? 

566
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,160
Now don't that make a pretty picture? 

567
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,240
Where's Billy? 

568
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,520
- Out of the way.
- Don't do it! 

569
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,440
All this shooting and he ain't even touched him yet. 

570
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,720
Turkey... 

571
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,520
Billy! Are you crazy?! 

572
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,600
All right, Yellowleg. This is it. 

573
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,800
- You and me.
- Move out, Billy. Move out. I ain't got time for you. 

574
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:44,440
There ain't but two horses in this town. You know only two people are gonna ride out of here alive. 

575
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,640
You turned on me, Billy. And I raised him from a puppy. 

576
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,600
I'm not giving him this money. 

577
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,400
No... 

578
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,840
Get me some slave Indians... I'll train them myself. 

579
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,720
Take all this money... 

580
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,360
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH 

581
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,800
Yellowleg, Yellowleg, listen to me. We can make ourselves a deal. 

582
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:49,680
I don't want that Billy with me. I want you! Look at you. I put you in that uniform. 

583
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,960
Now come on, listen to reason. 

584
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,200
Why can't a Yankee join up with a Rebel? 

585
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:05,840
We could do it together. Look at all this money here. Look. I'll give it all to you. 

586
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,800
I'll make a general out of you. General Yellowleg. Think of how you'd look in one of these caps... 

587
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,440
Listen, Yellowleg, like I told you up there... 

588
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:53,040
- You're gonna be in my army. I'll make a general out of you with gold braid.
- Remember that? 

589
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,400
You know where you left it, don't you? 

590
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,880
- Chickamauga.
- Look at it. 

591
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:07,680
- No... Oh, Yellowleg, listen to me, I don't want that Billy...
- Look at me! 

592
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:14,680
Yellowleg, I'll make a general out of you. You'll look good in that gold braid. Listen to me... 

593
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,520
- Oh...
- Don't! 

594
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,040
Get out of here! 

595
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,320
Don't do it! 

596
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,440
Aah! 

597
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,320
(TURK) Billy! 

598
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,240
Billy! 

599
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:04,000
You tell Yellowleg it's a fact I got soldiers! 

600
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,360
HORSES APPROACH 

601
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,680
Hi. We're trailing a couple of bank robbers. You got one of them. 

602
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:57,280
- Where's the other?
- Inside. Looks like they figured you didn't have guts enough to come here. 

603
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:03,520
- You know how people are. If it's their money, the gates of hell wouldn't stop them.
- Sure. 

604
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,960
Parson, we're going to need a few of the right kind of words from you. 

605
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:13,320
- We're burying a boy alongside of his dad.
- I'll say the right words. 

606
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:50,280
- This is a convoy.
- Yes, sir. 
- Gentlemen, you're going to make great officers in my army. 

607
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:56,360
I'll soon have your uniforms for you. Gold braid. And then we'll start training... 

608
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:03,320
Thank you, sir. Well, Captain, if you'll say, "Forward, yo!" to these ranks, we'll go. 

609
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,360
Forward, yo! 

610
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,400
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah 

611
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,400
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah... # 

612
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,440
Fill up those ranks! 

613
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,360
Forward march! Follow me, men! 

614
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,800
We'll get us an army, we know what to do. 

615
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,560
We buy some slave Indians... 

616
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
# Each day when I awaken 

617
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,160
# No more I face the empty dawn 

618
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:54,600
# For I know that my heart is not forsaken 

619
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,560
# The dream of love that once I knew 

620
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:06,480
# Now lingers beyond the empty dawn 

621
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:13,880
# No more is my lonely heart broken... #

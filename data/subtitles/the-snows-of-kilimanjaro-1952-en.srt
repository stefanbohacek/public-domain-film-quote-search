- Oh,just put it right there, please.
- Yes, darling.

457
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Hmm? Oh!
I thought you were--

458
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
- On the table, sahib.
- Look what just arrived.

459
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
A letter from the publisher
and a check.

460
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,800
It isn't very much,
but it's a check.

461
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,900
- Everything's gonna work out all right.
- What will, darling?

462
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
All of it.

463
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,100
Say, what'd old sawbones say?

464
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,900
Nothing frightful?
Didn't pick up a fever?

465
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
- No, I--
- What did I tell you?

466
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,000
All you need's a change of climate.
We'll go directly to Madrid.

467
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,800
We'll have the bullfights,
the Grecos at del Prado...

468
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,300
then up to Pamplona
in time for the fiesta.

469
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,400
- Harry.
- Luckiest timing in the world.

470
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,300
Darling, couldn't we just go home?

471
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,600
Home?

472
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Where's that?

473
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,000
You mean back to Paris.

474
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,100
Well, why?

475
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,400
Just to go home.

476
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,400
Look, darling, we can get
a nice apartment with the check...

477
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
with a room for you to work in.

478
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,900
You don't have to go
to Spain, do you?

479
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,900
No, darling, I don't
have to go to Spain...

480
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
or anyplace else.

481
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,300
You just want to.

482
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:11,400
Look, Cynthia, if I have to sound
like a lousy stiff that had a mission.

483
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm trying to become a writer.

484
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,300
It's a writer's business
to buzz around...

485
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,900
find out about things for himself...

486
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,800
not sit on his can in a comfortable chair
and reach for a bookcase...

487
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,100
for something to crib from.

488
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,200
And after Spain?

489
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,100
How do we know?

490
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,300
I mean, you never want
this other normal thing?

491
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm trying to explain
what is my normal thing.

492
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,200
- With maybe children?
- Children?

493
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,800
Darling, I want a child
more than anything in the world.

494
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,300
Something of my very own
to hold on to.

495
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,200
Well! Well, sure.
[ Chuckling ]

496
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,900
I love kids, but later.

497
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,300
We've got lots of time.

498
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,600
Look, Cyn, the world is a market...

499
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,100
in which you buy
what you want--

500
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,600
not just with money, but with your time,
with a lot of things.

501
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,300
It's an exchange.
You give something, and you get something.

502
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,400
I'm giving up a piece of my life...

503
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,200
to get something
that I need for my work.

504
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,600
Later on, we can afford what we can afford.
It's as simple as that.

505
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,800
I see.

506
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
Can I fix you a drink?

507
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,700
It's a little bit early, isn't it?

508
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,200
It seems to me to be just about
the right time. Do you object?

509
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
No.

510
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,700
Look, Cyn, if you have
this yen to go to Paris...

511
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,500
well, you can go there.

512
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
Without you?

513
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,800
I'm not saying that I want it.

514
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm just saying
that you can go there.

515
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,200
Or if--

516
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,000
If it's a matter
of life and death...

517
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,700
okay, I'll go with you.

518
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,300
I'll go change the tickets.

- I'm Dr. Simmons.
- How do you do? How is she?

524
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,600
I'm sorry to have to tell you
she lost the child.

525
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,100
- The what?
- You didn't know, Mr. Street?

526
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,300
Exactly what happened?

527
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,600
They told me at the hotel that there'd ...
been an accident. That's all.

528
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,200
A nasty fall. She'll be quite all right
after a few days' rest.

529
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,100
Do you actually mean
you didn't know about the child?

530
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,500
Don't you people talk to each other?

531
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,000
You did it deliberately.

532
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,000
- It was an accident.
- You did it because of what I said.

533
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,500
It was an accident.
I stumbled.

534
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,800
You didn't have any right to do it.

535
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,200
It was my child too, you know.

All right. The dancer likes you.
I like you too, darling.

Darling, you don't want to be childish.
You've read it.

They offered me an assignment

between the Syrians and the French.

Yes, that's what it said,
but that isn't what it meant.

- It meant that I'm beginning
a lifetime without you.
- That's real nonsense.

Then why didn't you ask me
to go with you?

I expected it to come like a gift.

I'm a drag on you,
and I hate every bit of it.

You've got to forget that.
You're driving yourself crazy.

00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,600
Yes, I ought to forget.

584
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,400
I ought to just go back
to Paris alone, as you say...

585
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,800
and not drive myself crazy at all
while I wait for you and wait and wait.

00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,500
Don't you even know you're lying?

00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,500
- I'm not lying.
- No.

588
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,700
No, it isn't a lie yet.

589
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,600
It won't be a lie until you go away
and discover you're not coming back...

590
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,700
but are going on and on
and see the whole world...

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,600
even if you lose it for us.

592
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,400
You know, I think this dancer
likes me very much.

593
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,300
All right, the dancer
likes you very much.

594
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,300
It ought to make me very happy.

595
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,500
It makes me feel dreadful.

596
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,100
Shall we invite him
over to the table?

597
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,200
Do you think his manners
would be as nice as yours?

598
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,200
Do you think he'd ask me first
if I'm Harry's lady?

599
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,100
Women can pick the times
to start a row.

600
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,500
It's not a row, darling.
It's very sad.

601
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,400
You with your ambition,
me with my guilt.

602
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,900
A lot of things are sad.

603
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,100
Why do they put the pads on the horses
in the bullfights?

604
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,000
- I've told you that.
- Tell me again.

605
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,900
It isn't so the horses
won't feel the hurt, is it?

606
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
It's only for the spectators...

607
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,000
so they won't see
the horses' insides.

608
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,200
Yes, it is for the protection
of the spectators.

609
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,300
I knew you wouldn't like the horses.

610
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,700
But I desperately like the horses.

611

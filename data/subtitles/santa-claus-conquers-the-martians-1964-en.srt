NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): At this time,

3
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:15,125
Station KID-TV brings you the
special event of the year,

4
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,888
a first in television history.

5
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,111
At this very moment,
KID-TV has standing

6
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,955
by a television crew at
Santa Claus' workshop.

7
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:27,698
And in just a few seconds,
our special correspondent,

8
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:31,392
Andy Henderson, will bring you
a person to person interview

9
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:34,545
with Santa Claus himself,
direct from the North Pole,

10
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,317
where at the moment,
the temperature

11
00:02:36,317 --> 00:02:39,610
is 91 degrees below zero.

12
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,914
And now KID-TV takes
you via Telstar,

13
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,347
Andy Henderson at
the North Pole.

14
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:47,518
ANDY HENDERSON
(ON TV): Hi, kids.

15
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:50,521
This is Andy Henderson
at the North Pole.

16
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,235
Whoo, it's cold up here.

17
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:56,947
From this spot, there's only
one direction you can go,

18
00:02:56,947 --> 00:03:00,150
and that's south.

19
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,752
Living up here is pretty rough.

20
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:04,615
I don't see how Santa stands it.

21
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:07,798
Since we've been here, we've
eaten nothing but frozen food.

22
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:11,792
At least, that's the way it
is by the time we get it.

23
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,645
And now, let's take a looksee
into Santa's workshop.

24
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,205
Hello again.

25
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:30,801
Boys and girls, it's just
weeks before Christmas,

26
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:33,734
and Santa and his helpers are
working overtime to make sure

27
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:38,329
that there's enough toys for
the kids all over the world.

28
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,870
Santa's a pretty
busy man, but I'm

29
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,135
sure he'd like to say a
few words to you kids.

30
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,206
Hello, Santa.

31
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,439
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, hello, son.

32
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,834
Oh, well, hello boys and girls.

33
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:57,388
Hey... oh, Andy, you caught
me at a very busy time.

34
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:58,619
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, uh, you

35
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,180
think you'll be ready
by Christmas Eve?

36
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,452
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, we've never

37
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,643
disappointed the kids yet.

38
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:07,127
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Tell
me, is it true that this year,

39
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,860
there's a rumor that you're
going to use a rocket sled?

40
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,822
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): No sir-ee.

41
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,595
We're going out the
good old fashioned way,

42
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:19,360
with my reindeer... Prancer and
Dancer, and Donner and Blitzen,

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,474
and Vixen and
Nixon... hey, Nixon?

44
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:26,066
Oh, where'd I get... Oh,
I always... confound it.

45
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,578
I get those names mixed up.

46
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:29,670
But the kids know their names.

47
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,323
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Santa, there you are.

48
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,575
We have so much to
do, and you stand here

49
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,707
dawdling, talking
to this visitor.

50
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:40,210
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Mr.
Anderson, this is Mrs. Claus.

51
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,252
Uh, well, dear,
we're on television.

52
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,054
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV): How
do you do, Mr. Anderson.

53
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:44,395
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ma'am.

54
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,566
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Now, I want you

55
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,078
to go and finish painting
those hobby horses.

56
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:49,179
Television?

57
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,712
Did you say we're on television?

58
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:53,514
Oh, oh dear.

59
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:55,346
Oh, why didn't you tell me?

60
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,418
Oh, my hair's a mess.

61
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,410
Mm-mm... H-hello there.

62
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,851
Oh, oh!

63
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,218
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Come along, Mr. Anderson,

64
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:11,291
and I'll show you some of the
new toys we're turning out.

65
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,699
How's it going, Winky?

66
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,041
WINKY (ON TV): Everything
is A-OK, Santa.

67
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,312
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Good man.

68
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,725
Winky is in charge of
our space department.

69
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,066
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ah.

70
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,208
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, now here,

71
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,531
here is the latest toy rocket.

72
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,133
It runs on real rocket fuel.

73
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,725
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Really?

74
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,478
I've been wondering, what is
this strange little creature

75
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:38,609
over here?

76
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,901
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Oh, uh, Winky made that.

77
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,783
That's his idea of a Martian.

78
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,164
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): A Martian?

79
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:46,046
Wow-ee-wow, I'd hate
to meet a creature

80
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,408
like that on a dark night.

81
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:48,529
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh-ho-ho.

82
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:49,900
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): I wonder if there

83
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,821
really are people on Mars.

84
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,052
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, who knows.

85
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,323
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, if there

86
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,275
are, I hope they have someone
like you up there, Santa,

87
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:58,439
to bring joy and good cheer
to all the Martian children.

88
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,682
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh,
Mr. Anders... Ho-ho-ho.

89
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:03,484
Well, keep going, Winky.

90
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,386
Christmas Eve is coming soon.

91
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:08,318
Now Mr. Anderson, I want to
show you some more things.

92
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,129
Now you...

93
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:09,830
Dropo?

94
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:14,194
Dropo, you lazy,
good-for-nothing,

95
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,406
where are you?

96
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,573
Dropo, Dropo, wake up.

97
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:23,564
Wake up.

98
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:30,821
[LAUGHING]

99
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:34,775
Oh, please turn
off that tickle ray.

100
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,257
KIMAR: Stand up.

101
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:38,128
Stand up.

102
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:42,743
Stand up.

103
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,395
Stand up.

104
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,247
I'm sorry, Ki... Kimar, sir.

105
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:50,020
Dropo, you are the
laziest man on Mars.

106
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,813
Why are you sleeping
during working hours?

107
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,895
I wasn't sleeping, Chief.

108
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:56,797
It's just that I haven't
been able to sleep

109
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:58,779
these last few nights.

110
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,020
I forgot how.

111
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,061
So I was just practicing.

112
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:08,138
Well I suggest you
practice doing your work.

113
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,359
Where's Lady Momar?

114
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,961
Oh, she went to
the food pill center

115
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,793
to get some new food pills.

116
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:14,384
The children haven't
been eating well.

117
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:15,876
No appetite at all.

118
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,458
Oh, it's no wonder.

119
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,199
They sit in front of
the video set all day,

120
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,582
watching those ridiculous
Earth programs.

121
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,614
It confuses them.

122
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:25,506
Where are they?

123
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:28,168
Oh, in there watching
Earth programs.

124
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:39,069
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Say,
Santa, what have we here?

125
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,440
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
These are new dolls.

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,825
Now, this little doll
walks, talks, cries,

127
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:47,207
and she even sings.

128
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,820
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Almost
like a real, live little girl.

129
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,763
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): That
she is sir, that she is.

130
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,306
All she needs is
tender loving care.

131
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:59,249
Bomar, what is a doll?

132
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,031
I don't know, Girmar.

133
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,893
What is tender loving care?

134
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,284
I don't know, either.

135
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:08,659
Bomar, Girmar, I
told you not to watch

136
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,931
those silly Earth programs.

137
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,142
Now go to sleep.

138
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,324
Must we go to
sleep now, Father?

139
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,597
I want to see Santa
Claus some more.

140
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,468
I want to see more toys.

141
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:19,169
No.

142
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:19,890
Go to sleep.

143
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:38,639
Hello, Dropo.

144
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,310
I see you're keeping busy.

145
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,863
Oh, I've been working
very hard, Lady Momar.

146
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,555
I've been vacuuming the room.

147
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:45,305
Good.

148
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,547
Is the master here?

149
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:47,628
Oh, he's in there.

150
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,030
And Kimar is very angry, too.

151
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,052
Kimar, I bought
some new food pills.

152
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,664
I hope the children
will eat these.

153
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:59,269
We have hamburger, buttered
asparagus, mashed potatoes,

154
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,373
and a special treat for them,
chocolate layer cake pills.

155
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:06,647
Momar, I'm worried
about our children.

156
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,529
So am I. They've hardly
eaten a thing in three days.

157
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,702
It goes deeper than that.

158
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:12,873
They're behaving strangely.

159
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:13,934
They appear to be troubled.

160
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,696
They don't care to sleep.

161
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:18,589
I had to use the sleep
spray on them again.

162
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,500
I mentioned this to my
council chiefs today,

163
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,413
and I learned it's the same with
children all around the planet,

164
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:25,786
in every district.

165
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:29,890
Something is happening
to the children of Mars.

166
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,212
Kimar, as the leader
of the Martians,

167
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:35,345
you must do something about it.

168
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,628
I know, but what?

169
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,620
Why don't you go to
the forest and see

170
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,201
Chochem, the ancient one.

171
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,322
He'll know what to do.

172
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,844
He's never failed you.

173
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,585
You speak wisely.

174
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,268
I will go.

175
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,040
Attention, council chiefs.

176
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,741
Please report.

177
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:54,715
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Lomas reporting.

178
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,216
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Rigna reporting.

179
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:57,788
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Hargo here.

180
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:00,070
Voldar?

181
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,552
Voldar, please report.

182
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,945
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Voldar reporting.

183
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:07,447
Gentlemen of the council,
we will meet immediately

184
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,260
at Chochum's Chair
in Thunder Forest.

185
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,532
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON INTERCOM):
What's wrong now, Kimar?

186
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:14,805
I don't know, Voldar.

187
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,156
But I mean to find out.

188
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:20,440
Where's Kimar?

189
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,783
He should be here any moment.

190
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:24,264
What's this all about?

191
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:26,757
We'll find out
when Kimar arrives.

192
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:30,330
We are probably going to
seek the advice of Chochum.

193
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,303
What does Kimar think we
are, a kindergarten class?

194
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:35,235
Can't we make our own decisions?

195
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,078
Must we always come crawling
to that [INAUDIBLE] old man?

196
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,070
Chochum is 800 years old.

197
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,603
You can't dismiss the
wisdom of centuries.

198
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:44,484
I can.

199
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:45,185
Gentlemen.

200
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,399
Thank you for coming.

201
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:54,614
Chochum?

202
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,321
Chochum, are you here?

203
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:05,726
Ancient One of Mars,
I call upon you.

204
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:10,300
Chochum, it is I, Kimar,
and the council chiefs.

205
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,601
We need you, Chochum.

206
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:36,496
You called me, Kimar?

207
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,890
We need your advice, Chochum.

208
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,723
Something is wrong
with our children.

209
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:43,864
They eat not.

210
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:45,615
They sleep not.

211
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:48,338
Their only interest is
watching meaningless Earth

212
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:50,741
programs on the video.

213
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:55,295
Wh-wh-what time
of year is it now?

214
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:57,107
KIMAR: It is the
middle of Septober.

215
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,639
No, no.

216
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,082
Not here.

217
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,203
I mean on Earth.

218
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,969
Ah, yes.

219
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:13,433
It is early December on Earth.

220
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,725
Close to the time
of the Christmas.

221
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:21,171
That explains it.

222
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:23,904
What is a Christmas?

223
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:30,680
It is an occasion for great joy
and peace on the planet Earth.

224
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:39,960
And for children, it is
also a time of anticipation,

225
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,706
as they await the arrival of
Santa Claus and his gifts.

226
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:49,379
Bah, what nonsense.

227
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,482
What has this to do with
our children, Ancient One?

228
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:56,726
We have no children on Mars.

229
00:12:56,726 --> 00:13:02,452
They have children's bodies,
but with adult minds.

230
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,294
They do not have a childhood.

231
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:12,542
I've seen this
coming for centuries.

232
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,885
They are born.

233
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:18,829
Our electronic teaching machines
are attached to their brains

234
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,052
while they are in their cradles.

235
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:27,607
Information is fed into their
minds in a constant stream.

236
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,822
And by the time they can
walk, they are adults.

237
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:37,817
They've never played.

238
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,451
They've never
learned to have fun.

239
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:46,957
And now, now they are rebelling.

240
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:49,069
What do you advise?

241
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,813
The children must be
allowed to be children again.

242
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:57,357
They must learn to play.

243
00:13:57,357 --> 00:14:02,282
They must learn what
it means to have fun.

244
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:05,936
We need a Santa Claus on Mars.

245
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:30,560
Santa Claus on Mars?

246
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,402
Where will we
get a Santa Claus?

247
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:36,927
There's only one Santa
Claus, and he's on Earth.

248
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:39,869
Well, I guess that
takes care of that.

249
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,972
Didn't I tell you it
was a foolish idea

250
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,483
to seek advice
from that old man?

251
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,445
This is a serious
matter, Voldar.

252
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:48,638
And desperate problems
require desperate deeds.

253
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,151
Earth has had Santa
Claus long enough.

254
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,052
We will bring him to Mars.

255
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,363
I'm against it.

256
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:55,665
Our children are fine
the way they are.

257
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:58,638
I don't want any Santa Claus
bringing them toys and games.

258
00:14:58,638 --> 00:14:59,950
They'll start
playing and laughing

259
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,790
and running under foot.

260
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,771
They'll become a nuisance.

261
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,623
I've made my decision.

262
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,386
We leave for Earth tonight.

263
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:09,469
Rigna, Lomas, prepare
spaceship number one.

264
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,675
Approaching
projected Earth orbit.

265
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,802
Fire port side rockets
number one and number two.

266
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:06,987
Port side rockets number
one and number two, fired.

267
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,951
Entering Earth orbit.

268
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,323
All right, Voldar.

269
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,085
Now to find Santa Claus.

270
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,037
Turn on your magnascope
to third power.

271
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:23,973
We're over a city of some kind.

272
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,641
So that's what the Earth
people call a city, eh?

273
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:33,523
How primitive.

274
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:36,676
Look at all those
buildings above ground.

275
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:40,140
Why, we could destroy that city
with one blast of our Q-ray.

276
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,532
We've not come here
to destroy anyone.

277
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:46,486
Our only purpose is to bring
Santa Claus back to Mars.

278
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:48,118
Turn to fifth power.

279
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:49,989
Let's see if we can
locate Santa Claus.

280
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,226
He wears a red suit,
trimmed with white fur,

281
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:58,348
and he has a long white beard.

282
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,610
But there are millions
of people down there.

283
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,894
It's like looking for a speck
of space dust in a comet's tail.

284
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:06,066
Wait a minute.

285
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,047
I see him.

286
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:08,318
I see Santa Claus.

287
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:12,372
I see him, too.

288
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:14,704
He's standing on the
corner, ringing a bell.

289
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:15,825
No he's not.

290
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,867
He's standing near the
entrance of a large building,

291
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,699
next to a large black kettle.

292
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:20,980
He's standing on
the corner, Kimar.

293
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,952
He's... wait a minute.

294
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,334
I see another one.

295
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,106
Why, there are hundreds of
Santa Clauses down there.

296
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:28,027
Are we going to bring them
all back with us to Mars?

297
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,299
Just one.

298
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,062
And with so many,
they won't miss one.

299
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,683
Prepare for landing
on next orbit.

300
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:34,784
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): We interrupt

301
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,776
our program with a
special bulletin.

302
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,698
An unidentified object
has been spotted

303
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:40,230
in orbit around the Earth.

304
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,232
The Soviet Union
denies it has launched

305
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,993
any new space satellites.

306
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:46,296
Our radar stations are
tracking the spaceship,

307
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,277
or whatever it is.

308
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,729
The US Air Force has
alerted all defense

309
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,030
commands and retaliatory units.

310
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:17,217
Sir, Earth radar beams
are bouncing off our ship.

311
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,759
Well, it certainly
took them long enough.

312
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,273
Voldar, turn on
the radar shield.

313
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:24,724
Dysfunctioning of radar shield.

314
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,116
Rigna, check the radar box.

315
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,990
Radar shield functioning.

316
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,872
What was wrong, Rigna?

317
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:35,275
A slight case of Dropo.

318
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,126
Oh, hi Chief.

319
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:37,407
What are you doing here, Dropo?

320
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,609
Oh, well, Chief, I went
to the launching pad

321
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:42,282
so I could say goodbye
to you, and I remembered,

322
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,233
I've never been to Earth!

323
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,234
So I thought I wanted to see...

324
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:46,005
I may leave you there
in place of Santa Claus.

325
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,327
Now get below.

326
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,808
I'll deal with you later.

327
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,733
Dropo, get below quickly.

328
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,514
Yes chief.

329
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:55,215
Yes.

330
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:55,915
Yes chief.

331
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:56,686
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,321
Prepare to land.

333
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:05,034
We'll set down in that
field near the lake.

one and two, fire.

All this trouble over a fat
little man in a red suit.

NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Here
is another UFO bulletin.

338
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:23,523
The Defense Department
has just announced

339
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:26,045
that the unidentified
flying object has suddenly

340
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,017
disappeared from
our radar screen.

341
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:30,810
They believe the object has
either disintegrated in space,

342
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,763
or it may be a spaceship
from some other planet, which

343
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:36,115
has the ability to
nullify our radar beams.

344
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:38,047
Because of the
ominous situation,

345
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:39,679
the president has
ordered the Strategic

346
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,261
Air Command into action.

NEWS ANCHOR (VOICEOVER):
The Defense Department

349
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,023
believes that the object
spotted on our radar screens

350
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:37,026
might have been nothing more
than a meteor which burned up

351
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:38,828
when it entered our atmosphere.

352
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:42,211
Professor [INAUDIBLE] Von
Green, our leading space expert,

353
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:45,084
is still convinced it
was a Martian spaceship.

Stay tuned for
further bulletins.

355
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,512
Billy, what does a
Martian look like?

356
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,493
I don't know.

357
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:56,155
Nobody's ever seen one.

358
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,518
I don't believe there
are any Martians.

359
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,569
You don't, huh?

360
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,762
What would you do if a Martian
walked right up behind you?

361
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,825
I'd scream.

Ah, stop doing that.

I'm trying to sleep.

365
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,181
I see a Martian.

Boy, you and your imagination.

00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:19,038
Come on, let's go home.

368
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,620
Who... who are you?

369
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,021
We're from Mars.

370
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,473
Don't be afraid.

371
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:26,055
We have children just
like you on Mars.

372
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:29,108
What are those funny things
sticking out of your head.

373
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,630
Those are our antenna.

374
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,972
Are you a television set?

375
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,345
Shh.

376
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,537
Stupid question.

377
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:40,109
Is this what you want to
do to our children on Mars?

378
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,101
Turn them into
nincompoops like these?

379
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,354
Hold your tongue, Voldar?

380
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:45,995
What's your name, little boy?

And this is my sister, Betty.

00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,353
Well perhaps you
can help us, Billy.

385
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,565
We're looking for one
of your Santa Clauses.

386
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,687
There's only one Santa Claus.

387
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,769
We've seen many of
them in your cities.

Oh.

Those are his helpers.

There's only one
real Santa Claus.

391
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:08,518
And he's in his workshop
up at the North Pole.

00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:10,470
That's what we came
here to find out.

Come on, you two.

Let me go!

00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,194
Where are you taking us?

397

Leave them alone, Voldar!

What?

399
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,828
And leave them here to
inform the authorities?

00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:20,019
He's right, Kimar.

401
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,811
We'd better take them along
with us to North Pole.

402
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:25,765
Very well.

morning, two children

00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:36,766
disappeared mysteriously in
the vicinity of Welsh Lake.

The police have found no clues.

And it seems as though
Billy and Betty Foster

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,612
have simply vanished
into thin air.

409

This appears to be a
day when everything

410
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:45,845
is vanishing into thin air.

411
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:47,717
While local police are
continuing their search

412
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,559
for the missing children,
the armed forces

413

for the mysterious object

414

from space.

415
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,666
All right, Billy and Betty.

00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,376
Nobody here.

00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:09,639
Come on in.

418
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,339
Golly.

419
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:14,744
Now, I'm not supposed
to bring you here.

420
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:18,418
The chief's going to be
awful mad if he finds us.

421
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:20,940
Boy, wait 'til the
kids at home find

422
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,724
that I was in a real
Martian spaceship.

423
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:28,367
No... no, don't touch anything.

424
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,109
Now, here.

425
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,662
That's the
anti-gravity generator.

426
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,455
And these are the retro rockets.

427
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,807
Does this light up?

428
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,570
Only when radar waves
are bouncing off our ship.

429
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,652
Then we put up
this radar screen.

430
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:44,734
Then nobody can
find us in space.

431
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:47,026
Boy, that's pretty sharp.

432
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,397
Yep.

433
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:49,999
What's this, Dropo?

434
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:52,201
Oh, that's the elevator signal.

435
00:23:52,201 --> 00:23:54,263
That light starts
flashing when somebody's

436
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:55,555
coming up from the
navigation deck.

437
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,071
Oh... oh, oh.

438
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,563
BILLY: Somebody's coming up.

439
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,555
We better get out of here.

440
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:06,546
No, no, no!

441
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,047
There's no time for that.

442
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,038
Oh, oh, I'm in trouble.

443
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,530
Oh, no time.

444
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,521
Here.

445
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:12,321
Here, here.

446
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,022
Quick.

447
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,493
Thinking of taking another
nap in the radar box, Dropo?

448
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:35,915
Oh, oh, no sir.

449
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,898
As a matter of fact, I
was just looking in there

450
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:42,051
to remind myself never
to hide in there again.

451
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:42,752
I bet.

452
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,452
No.

453
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,146
Approaching North Pole.

454
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:52,792
I can see Santa Claus' workshop.

455
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,498
Prepare for landing.

456
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,891
Hargo, set the rocket silences.

457
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,192
Dropo?

458
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:05,194
You stay aboard and
guard those children.

459
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:07,707
They must not
leave the ship now.

460
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,810
Now, or never?

461
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,151
What do you mean, Voldar?

462
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:14,353
If we take them
with us to Mars,

463
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:17,376
Santa's disappearance
would remain a mystery.

464
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,639
No one on Earth will
ever know that Santa

465
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,320
Claus was kidnapped by Martians.

466
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:25,565
Perhaps you're right.

467
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,255
Dropo?

468
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:27,046
Yes sir?

469
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:28,337
Get back to those
children, and don't

470
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:29,458
let them out of your sight.

471
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,159
Understand?

472
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,140
Yes, sir I understand.

473
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,371
I... I'll keep an eye.

474
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,923
We've landed.

475
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,045
Secure the ship.

476
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,387
Lomas, you remain
on guard and have

477
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:51,420
the ship ready for
immediate blast off.

478
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,222
Rigna, Hargo, Voldar,
you'll accompany me.

479
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:53,923
Come.

480
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,565
We'll activate Torg.

481
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:57,046
Torg?

482
00:25:57,046 --> 00:26:00,770
To capture a roly poly
little man like Santa Claus?

483
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,051
We don't need Torg.

484
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:04,483
We won't take any chances.

485
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:05,725
Come.

486
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:06,836
Nothing can stop Torg.

487
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:29,288
They're going to kidnap
Santa Claus, and us, too.

488
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,850
Not if we can help it.

489
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,693
We've got to get out
of here and warn Santa.

490
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,984
What's a Torg?

491
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:38,307
I don't know, but
I'm not afraid of it.

492
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,929
It's not going to stop us.

493
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:41,280
Come on.

494
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,161
Wait, Betty.

495
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,709
BETTY: Why did you do that?

496
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,320
If this ship ever
leaves Earth, we'll

497
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,532
have the whole US
Space Force after them.

498
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:54,233
Come on.

499
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,224
Wait a minute.

500
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:05,174
Come on.

501
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:24,583
BILLY: Come on, Betty.

502
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:18,718
This action must
take place swiftly.

503
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:20,619
We can't afford to
make any mistakes.

504
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:23,682
Hargo, you cover the
rear of the workshop.

505
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:27,056
Rigna, Voldar, cover
the front entrance.

506
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,597
I'll direct Torg.

507
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:30,609
Voldar isn't here.

508
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:35,384
Rigna, go up and
tell Voldar... Voldar,

509
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:38,267
this is another one of
your delaying tactics.

510
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:40,549
You've been opposing
me at every turn.

511
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:43,092
Now I'm warning you,
change your attitude.

512
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,735
You finished, Chief?

513
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:46,435
Yes I am.

514
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,107
And you will be, too,
if you're not careful.

515
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:51,510
Oh, but I am carefully, Chief.

516
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,412
So careful that I looked
in at the children

517
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:54,723
before I left the ship.

518
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:56,115
You stay away from
those children.

519
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:57,857
That will be easy to do.

520
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,488
They've escaped.

521
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,670
Voldar, if this is
your idea of a joke...

522
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,012
Ask Dropo.

523
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,884
They overheard our plans.

524
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:07,146
At this very moment, they're
on their way to Santa Claus

525
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,077
to warn him.

526
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:09,498
It's true, Kimar.

527
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,531
Their footprints.

528
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,843
We must stop them.

529
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:16,625
Those children mustn't
reach Santa Claus.

530
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,536
Follow them.

531
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,848
I'll put Torg on the trail.

532
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:26,205
Torg, come out of the spaceship.

533
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:27,596
Torg.

534
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:29,278
Come out of the spaceship.

535
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:40,629
Billy, I can't run anymore.

536
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,101
I'm cold.

537
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,053
And I'm tired.

538
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:46,505
And it's beginning to snow.

539
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:47,977
Please, Betty.

540
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:48,948
Try.

541
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:50,910
We've got to warn Santa.

542
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,381
We can't stop now.

543
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,843
They might catch us.

544
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:56,295
Where is Santa?

545
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,276
BILLY: I don't know.

546
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:00,589
His workshop must be
somewhere around here.

547
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:06,045
Betty, look.

548
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:08,037
It's Voldar.

549
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:12,011
BETTY: He's the mean one,
the one who doesn't like us.

550
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,002
Come on.

551
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:34,353
Get back.

552
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:55,564
Don't move, Betty.

553
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,026
I'll go take a look.

554
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:07,076
It's all right now, Betty.

555
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:07,776
Come on.

556
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,312
I'm cold.

557
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:16,395
I wish it wouldn't snow.

558
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:18,857
That's the best thing
that could happen.

559
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:22,041
It'll cover our tracks and
be harder for the Martians

560
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,322
to find us.

561
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:27,346
And it'll be harder for us
to find Santa's workshop.

562
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:29,278
I'm scared.

563
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,210
We'll find it.

564
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,661
Which way is north?

565
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:39,428
I see it!

566
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:40,409
I see it!

567
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:42,051
Santa's workshop.

568
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,102
BILLY: Where?

569
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,103
Right there.

570
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,594
See the light?

571
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:47,586
Where?

572
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,578
The lights are moving.

573
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:59,058
They're coming towards us.

574
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:02,041
Betty, that's
not Santa's house.

575
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,753
Wha... What is it?

576
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:05,594
BILLY: I don't know.

577
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:36,115
Good work, Torg.

578
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:37,396
Now destroy them.

579
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:38,797
Crush them.

580
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:40,199
Crush them, Torg.

581
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,690
Do as I say.

582
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,313
Voldar, I knew you'd
try something like this.

583
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:47,036
I set Torg's controls
so he will obey only me.

584
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:48,857
Release them, Torg.

585
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,629
You were very lucky.

586
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:52,901
Now don't try to escape again.

587
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:54,743
You may not be so
lucky next time.

588
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:59,058
Hargo, take them back to ship,
lock them up, and rejoin us.

589
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:02,021
You won't get away with
this, you... you Martian!

590
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,417
The danger grows
with every minute.

591
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,719
Let's get Santa
Claus and blast off.

592
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:14,013
We'll surround the workshop
and send Torg in to get Santa.

593
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:16,115
Nobody is to be harmed
unless they get in our way.

594
00:33:16,115 --> 00:33:17,626
Right.

595
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:19,878
No one is to be harmed.

596
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:23,032
What has happened to the
great warriors of our planet?

597
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:26,125
Mars used to be
the planet of war.

598
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:31,340
Mark my words, Kimar, your
softness will destroy us.

599
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,643
Santa Claus, toys,
games, laughing children.

600
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:36,635
Well we shall see.

601
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:39,828
But for now, to your posts.

602
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:41,340
Torg, follow me.

603
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,131
Get him, Torg.

604
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,813
You can't come in here.

605
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,785
No one's allowed.

606
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:29,558
Well, where did you come from?

607
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:31,980
You're the biggest
toy I've ever seen.

608
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,691
[LAUGHING]

609
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:40,539
And very well, made too.

610
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:46,084
By the great dog star, Santa's
treating him like a toy.

611
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,045
Get him, Torg.

612
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,337
Grab him.

613
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,389
He's become a toy.

614
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,811
Rigna, we'll have to
get Santa ourselves.

615
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:53,512
Come on, Voldar.

616
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:01,150
What have we here?

617
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,711
More toys?

618
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:03,792
Those are Martians.

619
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:06,044
Santa Claus, you're
coming with us.

620
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:06,745
No.

621
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:07,886
You can't take him now.

622
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,138
It's too near Christmas.

623
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:09,888
Quiet, you.

624
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:10,589
But...

625
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:17,546
We don't want to
hurt you, Santa Claus,

626
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:18,717
so come along quietly.

627
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:28,927
Why... why did you have
to do that to my helper?

628
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:29,628
It's harmless.

629
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,312
It'll wear off in a short while.

630
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:35,294
Oh.

631
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:37,636
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

632
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,797
Now you come with us.

633
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:40,038
We need you on Mars.

634
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:50,889
Are you sure this is harmless?

635
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,363
Oh, I never saw
such lazy people,

636
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:56,785
standing around like statues.

637
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:58,397
There's work to be done.

638
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,518
Let's get to it.

639
00:36:02,831 --> 00:36:08,857
Oh me, oh my, oh me,
oh... oh, Mrs. Claus

640
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:12,791
is going to be very
angry about this.

641
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,294
Take him, Torg.

642
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:17,806
Torg, take him.

643
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:19,878
Obey my command.

644
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,820
Forget it, Kimar.

645
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,752
Rigna was right.

646
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:26,545
He's nothing but a toy now.

647
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:28,827
Best to leave him here.

648
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:34,683
Believe me, I had nothing
whatsoever to do about this.

649
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:38,046
You know my dear, I
can't recall a time

650
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:41,390
when you were so
silent for so long.

651
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,681
Let's go, old man.

652

NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): And Mrs.
Santa Claus has positively

653
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,136
identified the
kidnappers as Martians.

654
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:10,539
Never in the history of mankind
have the nations of the world

655
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,801
reacted with such
unanimity and cooperation.

until dawn in the United

00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:22,811
And at Cape Kennedy,
our correspondent

660
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:24,673
interviewed
[INAUDIBLE] Von Green,

661
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:27,145
the man in charge of
America's Starshot program.

662
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,517
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Mr. Von Green,

663
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:31,119
what is the space
agency doing about this?

664
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,241
VON GREEN (ON TV): Well, they
have mobilized all the men

665
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,914
and equipment in our
Starshot project.

666
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:37,286
And we have rushed
our astronauts

667
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,818
into an intensive program
for the final phase

668
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:40,969
of their training.

669
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,681
Now, our Starshot
ship is supposed

670
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:44,813
undergo six months
of test flights.

671
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:47,296
But we are going to
forget about the testing

672
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:50,819
and go after those
Martian monkeys.

673
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:52,291
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Isn't that risky?

674
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,822
VON GREEN (ON TV): Of
course it is risky.

675
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:57,025
But every one of our astronauts
is begging for the chance

676
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,578
to go after the Martians.

677
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:01,720
Who wouldn't give
everything to bring

678
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,522
Santa back to our children?

679
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:51,450
Earth hasn't reacted yet.

680
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,232
No radar beams being
bounced off our ship.

681
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,404
Looks like we made
a clean getaway.

682

[LAUGHING]

683
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:02,340
How's our captive?

684
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,082
He's having the
time of his life.

685
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:05,704
He's such a funny little man.

686
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:07,516
Why, I've only been with
him for five minutes,

687
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:10,779
and he has me laughing
just like an Earthling.

688
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:13,562
What's soft, and round,
and you put it on a stick,

689
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:17,295
and... and you toast it in
a fire, and it's green?

690
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:18,917
I don't know, what?

691
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:19,618
A Martian-mallow.

692
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:31,339
That's what you're all
becoming... Martian-mallows.

693
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:32,861
Soft.

694
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,543
Weak.

695
00:39:34,543 --> 00:39:37,185
That old man is a menace.

696
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:39,067
Gee, Santa, it's all our fault.

697
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,989
We told them where to find you.

698
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:45,193
Oh, balderdash and a
fiddle-dee-dee, Billy boy.

699
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:48,056
Everybody knows
where Santa lives.

700
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:52,370
Besides, I've always
wanted to visit Mars.

701
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,534
Mommy and Daddy are
going to be angry.

702
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:57,215
You think that's something?

703
00:39:57,215 --> 00:39:59,768
I can just see Mrs. Claus now.

704
00:39:59,768 --> 00:40:02,140
Christmas coming,
and I'm not there.

705
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,031
She'll have a fit.

706
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:09,778
Oh me oh my oh me.

707
00:40:09,778 --> 00:40:10,959
Come and get it.

708
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,461
Dinner time.

709
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:13,602
Here's Dropo.

710
00:40:13,602 --> 00:40:16,485
If I can't cheer
you up, Dropo can.

711
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:18,206
He always makes me laugh.

712
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:21,460
Oh, you'll have a
wonderful dinner tonight.

713
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,785
Oh, there's soup, and beef
stew, and chocolate ice cream.

714
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:28,787
No thank you, Dropo.

715
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,028
I'm not hungry.

716
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,930
Come on, Billy.

717
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,712
Oh.

718
00:40:33,712 --> 00:40:36,605
Well, is it all right if I
have your chocolate ice cream?

719
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:37,866
Sure.

720
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:40,519
Oh, I just love
chocolate ice cream.

721
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,064
Kimar, look at this.

722
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:48,016
That small blip is
not an asteroid.

723
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:50,909
It's a spaceship, and it's
on our tail, getting closer.

724
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,601
Impossible, Rigna.

725
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:53,602
They couldn't have spotted us.

726
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:55,083
We have our radar shield on.

727
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:58,096
I know that sir, but
they are gaining on us.

728
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,028
Is it possible Earth
has a secret device that

729
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:01,630
can penetrate our radar shield?

730
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,854
They have a secret device,
and his name is Billy Foster.

731
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,296
I warned you that these
Earthlings are dangerous.

732
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:11,139
They'll destroy us
if we allow them.

733
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,751
Well I won't allow them.

734
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:21,730
I think we underestimate
the resourcefulness

735
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,742
of these Earth people.

736
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,674
Very clever of the boy.

737
00:41:25,674 --> 00:41:27,415
Make the repairs, Rigna.

738
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:28,537
I'll take evasive action.

739
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,787
Well.

740
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:43,201
And how is Santa, and
the little Earthlings.

741
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:47,766
My, it must be tiresome
cooped up in this little room.

742
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:51,339
Say, how would you like to
see the rest of the ship?

743
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:52,561
You're not fooling me.

744
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,242
You don't like us.

745
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:56,084
You're mean.

746
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:57,465
Oh, come on now.

747
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:59,297
That's not true.

748
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:03,191
Why, Santa makes everyone
feel good, even me.

749
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:04,843
I don't trust you.

750
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:06,895
Now, now, Billy boy.

751
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:09,287
That's not the Christmas spirit.

752
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:11,409
Why, of course, Voldar.

753
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:15,173
We'd love to take
the grand tour.

754
00:42:15,173 --> 00:42:16,645
All right, children.

755
00:42:33,622 --> 00:42:34,663
This room is called...

756
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:35,513
Airlock.

757
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:36,544
That's right.

758
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:37,375
Sure.

759
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,967
This is where you
come when you're

760
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:40,629
ready to go out in space.

761
00:42:40,629 --> 00:42:42,090
It's airtight.

762
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:46,004
You put on your space suit,
and go out through that door.

763
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:48,376
When you come back,
the door closes,

764
00:42:48,376 --> 00:42:51,670
and they pump air back into
the room through there.

765
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,232
When it reaches the pressure
of the rest of the ship,

766
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:56,044
you can take your
space suit off.

Smart lad.

768
00:42:57,425 --> 00:43:00,188
Well, where's the control that
opens the door [INAUDIBLE]?

769
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:01,189
Not here.

770
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:03,602
That's in the control deck.

771
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:06,104
You see, once you
pull that switch,

772
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:09,988
the warning bell sounds, and
in 60 seconds, that door opens.

773
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,175
Santa, that clock stopped.

774
00:43:17,175 --> 00:43:18,386
60 seconds.

775
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:19,597
That must be the door timer.

776
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:25,734
Santa, he locked us in.

777
00:43:25,734 --> 00:43:27,786
Oh, I don't think so.

778
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:31,299
He probably just stepped
out for a moment.

779
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:32,240
It's locked.

780
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,662
I don't trust Voldar.

781
00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:35,553
He's not like Kimar
and the others.

782
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:37,455
I don't like him.

783
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:38,566
I'm worried, Santa.

784
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,660
Now, now, children,
let's not get excited.

785

It's Voldar.

the space door.

Help, Kimar!

00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,281
Help!

790
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:23,631
Gee, Santa, what
are we going to do?

791
00:44:23,631 --> 00:44:25,623
Once that door opens,
we haven't got a chance.

792
00:44:29,097 --> 00:44:31,079
Eh.

793
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,431
Where'd you say this
leads to, Billy?

VOLDAR: Seven six, five,
four, three, two, one, zero.

00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:50,278
No one, now.

What's going on, Voldar?

Oh, Chief, Santa and
the children are missing.

799

Before I'm through
with you, Voldar,

left in the airlock,

and then came up here and
accidentally threw the door

Eh, accidentally, of course.

through the air duct.

The air duct.

814

But the air duct
is just a little,

Santa, tomorrow we'll
set up a workshop for you.

It won't be exactly the same

but I'm sure it'll
serve your purpose.

Good, good.

00:51:04,402 --> 00:51:08,136
Now, I'd like to get going and
have the toy shop operating

return to Earth for Christmas.

very good-natured woman, but...

never return to Earth.

Well, we've no time to lose.

909
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:32,870
We must go into action.

910
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,702
Now we cannot
eliminate Santa Claus,

911
00:51:34,702 --> 00:51:37,235
but we can just
discredit him, make him

912
00:51:37,235 --> 00:51:38,866
a laughingstock throughout Mars.

913
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:39,567
Come on.

914
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,969
Now listen, carefully.

915
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,621
That workshop closes
at 10 o'clock.

916
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:46,754
The guards will be at Kimar's
house, guarding Santa Claus.

917
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:48,516
Now this is what we'll do, see?

918
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:50,118

Three baseball bats.

924
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:16,164

I'm not tired.

940
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,151
But my finger is.

941
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:57,134
It's been pressing
buttons all day long.

942
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:03,961
Well, I think I'll go in
and put my finger to bed.

943
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:04,662
Here, children.

Here's your milk.

You can play for half
an hour, and then

946
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:08,446
you'll have to go to bed.

the Earth program?

948
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:12,460
Certainly, dear.

949
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,801
But only for half an hour.

950
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:19,217

951
00:53:19,217 --> 00:53:20,808

952
00:53:20,808 --> 00:53:22,650
Don't you want to watch
the Earth programs?

953
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,432
Oh, no sir.

954
00:53:24,432 --> 00:53:27,104
We're not interested
in Earth programs.

955
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,306
I'm going to sleep.

956
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,237
Goodnight.

957
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:30,037
Me, too.

958
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:30,788
Just a moment.

959
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:31,529
Goodnight, Mr. Kimar.

960
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:33,731
Goodnight, Lady Momar.

961
00:53:33,731 --> 00:53:36,754
Just a moment, children.

962
00:53:36,754 --> 00:53:38,456
Are you feeling well?

963
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:40,187
Oh, we feel fine, sir.

964
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:41,609
Goodnight.

965
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:42,420
Goodnight.

966
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,273
KIMAR: Has someone
been mistreating you?

967
00:53:45,273 --> 00:53:46,764
Oh, no sir.

968
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:49,387
You and Lady Momar have
just been swell to us.

969
00:53:49,387 --> 00:53:50,087
Goodnight.

970
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:56,454
What could it be, Momar?

971
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:59,367
They're behaving the way
our children used to behave.

972
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:01,289
Can't you tell, Kimar?

973
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:03,321
They're homesick.

974
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:07,034
They miss their
parents, their friends.

975
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:09,006
Kimar, you've got to
send those children back.

976
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:13,411
Impossible.

977
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:41,759
Oh, now I'm Santa Claus.

978
00:54:41,759 --> 00:54:45,092
Ho, ho, ho.

979
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:46,714
Ho, ho, ho.

980
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:49,767
Merry Christmas everyone!

981
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:52,450
Ho, ho, ho.

982
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,981
My finger isn't tired.

983
00:54:53,981 --> 00:54:55,873
I think I'll go
down to the workshop

984
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:57,395
and make some more toys.

985
00:54:57,395 --> 00:55:00,247
Ho, ho, ho. (SINGING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

986
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:02,169
jingle all the way.

987
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:07,935
[HUMMING]

988
00:55:07,935 --> 00:55:11,669
VOLDAR: Shim, pull the light.

989
00:55:11,669 --> 00:55:12,480
No, the light.

990
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:19,807
Oh, ah, this is
going shake 'em up.

991
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,219
These toys will never
be the same again.

992
00:55:24,902 --> 00:55:25,603
Shh!

993
00:55:25,603 --> 00:55:26,303
Shh!

994
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:28,996
Shh!

995
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:29,827
Someone's coming.

996
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,268
Quick, down.

997
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:34,662
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

998
00:55:34,662 --> 00:55:39,517
Oh what fun it is to ride the
one horse open sleigh, hey.

999
00:55:39,517 --> 00:55:41,208
What a break.

1000
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:43,160
It's Santa Claus.

1001
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,472
He's alone.

1002
00:55:44,472 --> 00:55:46,824
No guards.

1003
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:50,297
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

1004
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:54,261
Oh what fun it is to
ride... oh, oh, oh.

1005
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:06,984
Now stay put, my
fat little friend.

1006
00:56:06,984 --> 00:56:08,386
Hey, Santa.

1007
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:09,497
How do you like this toy?

1008
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:11,929
Ho, ho, ho.

1009
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:13,781
My friend asked you a question.

1010
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:14,762
Answer him.

1011
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:16,233
Ho, ho, ho.

1012
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:17,214
Quiet, Shim.

1013
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:19,166
Put on a nuclear curtain.

1014
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:28,696
Tomorrow marks the end
of Operation Santa Claus.

1015
00:56:28,696 --> 00:56:30,908
And Mars returns to normal.

1016
00:56:37,024 --> 00:56:38,746
Dropo, we're here.

1017
00:56:38,746 --> 00:56:40,528
He's hiding, Santa.

1018
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:43,190
Oh, playing hide and seek, eh?

1019
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,843
All right, Dropo.

1020
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:49,196
Here we come, ready or not.

1021
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:56,213
He's not here, Santa.

1022
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,555
That's funny.

1023
00:56:57,555 --> 00:56:59,366
Oh, well, he'll turn up.

1024
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:00,067
Let's get started.

1025
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,233
Hey, ho!

1026
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:07,164
Ready?

1027
00:57:07,164 --> 00:57:09,036
OK.

1028
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:10,427
Let's go.

1029
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,820
One teddy bear and one doll.

1030
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,664
One teddy bear and one doll.

1031
00:57:20,558 --> 00:57:22,510
Santa, stop the machine!

1032
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,491
Look!

1033
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:25,432
The doll has a
teddy bear's head,

1034
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:28,846
and the teddy bear
has a doll's head.

1035
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,307
I can't understand it.

1036
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:32,409
Oh, let's try it again.

1037
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:34,091
What's next, Betty?

1038
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:35,543
One baseball bat.

1039
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:43,851
SANTA CLAUS: A baseball tennis...
Why, this will never do.

1040
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:45,883
The machine isn't working right.

1041
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:46,724
Oh, dear.

1042
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:48,155
What else, Betty?

1043
00:57:48,155 --> 00:57:50,117
A toy train.

1044
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:51,318
A toy train.

1045
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:52,079
Well, all right.

1046
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:52,780
Yes.

1047
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:59,106
Look at that.

1048
00:57:59,106 --> 00:58:02,309
Wha... Why, this
doesn't make sense.

1049
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:11,499
Well, this never happened
when we made toys by hand.

1050
00:58:11,499 --> 00:58:17,364
Something very strange
is happening here.

1051
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:21,098
Bomar, I think you'd
better call your father.

1052
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:25,903
Father?

1053
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:26,964
Father, this is Bomar.

1054
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:28,746
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): Yes, Bomar?

1055
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:30,968
Father, we're in the toy shop.

1056
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:32,980
Dropo was in here,
and there's something

1057
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,552
wrong with the toy machine, too.

1058
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,684
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM):
I'll be right over.

1059
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:38,085
Just a word of warning.

1060
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:41,068
If you got any big
ideas, forget them.

1061
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:42,740
If you walk through
that nuclear curtain,

1062
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,172
you'll be disintegrated
like that.

1063
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:59,076
Sabotage Somebody
switched all our wiring.

1064
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:00,137
Dropo's gone.

1065
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,879
Your suit is missing.

1066
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:05,643
And now, this machine's
been sabotaged.

1067
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:08,145
Put them all together,
it spells Voldar.

1068
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:12,610
He was here, and he
thought Dropo was me.

1069
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,431
He's got Dropo.

1070
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:17,024
And I've got to find him.

1071
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,325
Poor Dropo.

1072
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,672
Surprised to see us?

1073
00:59:24,672 --> 00:59:25,643
You're under arrest, Voldar.

1074
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,038
Stop playing with toys.

1075
00:59:31,038 --> 00:59:32,770
Put it away, Kimar.

1076
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,943
We have a weapon that's
much more potent than that.

1077
00:59:35,943 --> 00:59:39,226
As you may know, we are
holding Santa Claus a hostage.

1078
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:42,620
One false move, and your
little ho, ho, ho man

1079
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,702
will be destroyed.

1080
00:59:44,702 --> 00:59:45,402
All right.

1081
00:59:45,402 --> 00:59:46,604
What do you want, Voldar?

1082
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:49,967
These are our terms.

1083
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:52,710
First, destroy the toy machine.

1084
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,882
Second, we will
release Santa Claus

1085
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,054
if you promise to send
him and the Earthlings

1086
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:58,355
back to their planet.

1087
00:59:58,355 --> 01:00:03,040
Third, no more joy through
toys nonsense on Mars.

1088
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,121
Well?

1089
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:06,143
Well, you win.

1090
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,101
Are you sure you
have Santa Claus?

1091
01:00:14,101 --> 01:00:16,053
VOLDAR: You know we have him.

1092
01:00:16,053 --> 01:00:17,995
You mean you had him.

1093
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,522
How did he get out of the cave?

1094
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:26,954
Shim, that idiot!

1095
01:00:26,954 --> 01:00:29,817
A-a-and how'd he
get here s-s-so fast?

1096
01:00:29,817 --> 01:00:31,498
Santa Claus has powers
that you don't know about.

1097
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:32,199
All right.

1098
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,751
Arms up.

1099
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,342
Rigna, Hargo, Lomas, report.

1100
01:00:35,342 --> 01:00:36,744
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
This is Rigna, Kimar.

1101
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:38,796
Hargo and Lomas are with me.

1102
01:00:38,796 --> 01:00:39,636
Good.

1103
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,478
I've got Voldar and Stobo.

1104
01:00:41,478 --> 01:00:44,321
I'll keep them here in the
storeroom of the toy shop.

1105
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:46,343
Rigna, you come here and
take them off my hands.

1106
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,386
I want Hargo and Lomas to
look for a man named Shim.

1107
01:00:49,386 --> 01:00:51,999
Tell them to search the caves
along the Transverse Canal.

1108
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:53,130
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Right, Kimar.

1109
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,802
All right, you two.

1110
01:00:54,802 --> 01:00:55,502
In there.

1111
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,592
All right, you
might as well relax.

1112
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:06,824
You're going to be
here for a while.

1113
01:01:06,824 --> 01:01:07,524
Sit down.

1114
01:01:39,606 --> 01:01:40,587
SHIM: Where are you going?

1115
01:01:40,587 --> 01:01:42,569
Ho, ho, ho.

1116
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:46,033
Can't you say anything
else but ho, ho, ho?

1117
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,135
DROPO: Ho, ho, ho.

1118
01:01:48,135 --> 01:01:51,869
If you're thinking of leaving,
Santa, let me remind you.

1119
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:54,281
Once you hit that
nuclear curtain,

1120
01:01:54,281 --> 01:01:55,963
there won't even
be a whisker left.

1121
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,235
Ho, ho, ho.

1122
01:01:58,235 --> 01:01:59,226
SHIM: Hey, Santa!

1123
01:01:59,226 --> 01:02:00,227
Be careful!

1124
01:02:10,177 --> 01:02:11,809
What are you going
to do with us?

1125
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:13,801
You're going to stand
trial before the council.

1126
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:15,672
I don't think you'll be
causing any more trouble.

1127
01:02:29,827 --> 01:02:33,590
Well now, I think that
should do it, Billy boy.

1128
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,763
Close the door, son.

1129
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:38,205
Now, I think we need
a little red paint.

1130
01:02:38,205 --> 01:02:40,878
And you'll find it
in the storeroom.

1131
01:02:40,878 --> 01:02:41,819
Sure, Santa.

1132
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:42,519
Yes.

1133
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:43,330
That's a good boy.

1134
01:02:47,915 --> 01:02:50,367
VOLDAR: This time I'll take
care of Santa Claus for good,

1135
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,921
and smash that machine.

1136
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:54,882
Santa!

1137
01:02:54,882 --> 01:02:56,323
Santa!

1138
01:02:56,323 --> 01:02:58,305
Voldar and the other man
are in the storeroom,

1139
01:02:58,305 --> 01:02:59,536
and they're coming to get you.

1140
01:02:59,536 --> 01:03:01,809
Oh, they are, are they?

1141
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:07,034
Yeh... well, maybe they'd like
to have some fun with our toys,

1142
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:09,246
and we'll see that they do.

1143
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:10,337
Won't we kids.

1144
01:03:21,618 --> 01:03:23,931
Oh-ho, we meet again, eh?

1145
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:28,765
I don't know how you escaped
Shim, but you won't escape me.

1146
01:03:28,765 --> 01:03:29,546
You're through.

1147
01:03:29,546 --> 01:03:32,019
Voldar, why don't
you, uh, relax?

1148
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:36,954
You're going to
relax... permanently.

1149
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:56,203
You?

1150
01:04:56,203 --> 01:04:57,694
Wha... but, you're not here.

1151
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:59,686
You're in there.

1152
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:01,178
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1153
01:05:01,178 --> 01:05:02,169
I'm not here.

1154
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:04,161
I'm in there.

1155
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:05,702
Wait a minute.

1156
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:07,884
I'm going to see who
Voldar's fighting in there.

1157
01:05:11,768 --> 01:05:14,191
What happened?

1158
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,613
I don't know what's
going on in there,

1159
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,545
but I'm going to take
care of you myself.

1160
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:19,997
Now... now, just a minute.

1161
01:05:19,997 --> 01:05:22,699
Now I'd like to
talk to... Oh, boy,

1162
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:25,372
Chief, am I glad to see you.

1163
01:05:25,372 --> 01:05:26,753
All right, inside, Stobo.

1164
01:05:30,747 --> 01:05:32,749
All right, kids,
you can stop now.

1165
01:05:36,243 --> 01:05:37,744
I said cease fire.

1166
01:05:47,374 --> 01:05:48,075
All right, Rigna.

1167
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:48,775
Take them away.

1168
01:05:48,775 --> 01:05:49,606
They've had a rough day.

1169
01:05:57,714 --> 01:06:00,077
Ho, ho, ho, everybody.

1170
01:06:00,077 --> 01:06:02,049
Merry Christmas!

1171
01:06:05,512 --> 01:06:07,764
You don't need me here, Kimar.

1172
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:12,839
You've got a wonderful
Santa Claus of your own.

1173
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:14,341
Ho, ho, ho!

1174
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:20,007
Goodbye, Billy.

1175
01:06:20,007 --> 01:06:21,048
Goodbye.

1176
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:24,621
Goodbye, Betty dear.

1177
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:26,953
You take care of yourself.

1178
01:06:26,953 --> 01:06:28,825
Bye.

1179
01:06:28,825 --> 01:06:30,727
I've got something
for you, Billy.

1180
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:32,529
Gee, thanks.

1181
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:33,500
Goodbye.

1182
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,801
Bye.

1183
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:35,942
Gee, we had fun.

1184
01:06:35,942 --> 01:06:37,654
We're going to miss you.

1185
01:06:37,654 --> 01:06:39,846
Do you think we'll
ever meet again?

1186
01:06:39,846 --> 01:06:42,129
I'm sure you will, children.

1187
01:06:42,129 --> 01:06:44,081
Thank you, Santa, for
bringing happiness

1188
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:45,532
to the children of Mars.

1189
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:47,994
And the Christmas
spirit to all of us.

1190
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:51,628
Son, from the
bottom of my heart,

1191
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:58,014
I wish you and yours the
very best of everything.

1192
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,046
Ho, ho, ho!

1193
01:06:59,046 --> 01:07:02,749
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1194
01:07:02,749 --> 01:07:04,491
Dropo Claus is here.

1195
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:07,694
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

1196
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:11,458
Dropo, you put on weight.

1197
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:12,549
Oh, yes.

1198
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:14,000
No pillows, look.

1199
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,212
Look kids, no pillows.

1200
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:28,345
Now, if we hurry, we can get
back in time for Christmas Eve.

1201
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,237
KIDS: Yay!

1202
01:07:30,237 --> 01:07:33,800
Shall we get going?

1203
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,792
KIDS: Yay!

1204
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:37,794
Goodbye, dear friends.

1205
01:07:37,794 --> 01:07:38,495
Away!

1206
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:47,924
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1207
01:07:47,924 --> 01:07:49,926
Away!

1208
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:50,917
MARTIANS: Bye!

1209
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:52,419
Goodbye, Santa Claus!

1210
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:53,910
Goodbye!

1211
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:58,655

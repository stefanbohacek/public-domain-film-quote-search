1
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,198
Madagascar.

2
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,792
For centuries the
bloodiest cock pit of all the seas.

3
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,690
Where the infamous brotherhood
of the damned awaited to plunder the...

4
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:23,057
treasure laden galleons
from India and Cathay.

5
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:27,900
Then returned drunk with slaughter to
their pirate stronghold of Last Hope.

6
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:31,543
Most ruthless of
all was Captain William Kidd.

7
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:35,079
He encountered the great
London galleon the Twelve Apostles...

8
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:37,202
Commanded by Admiral Lord Blayne...

9
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:41,533
and approaching unsuspected
in the guise of a peaceful merchantman...

10
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:45,743
by a sudden treacherous salvo
he reduced her to a burning hulk.

11
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:51,478
When night fell, the Twelve Apostles
was only a blazing funeral pyre on the...

12
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:54,142
placid surface of a Madagascar lagoon.

13
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,954
Stab me, there's a pretty sight.

14
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:02,691
Will be prettier still when the
fire reaches the magazine Captain.

15
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:03,692
Pity though.

16
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:07,046
Lot of stout seamen among them.
And with us a long time.

17
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:11,451
We can none of us live
forever Mr Boyle, dead men don't talk.

18
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:15,612
Man your oars, we got
this job to do before high tide.

19
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:08,522
There, and dig faster, the tide catches
here it'll save the King's hangman some rope.

20
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,809
There you are, deep enough to bury a man in.

21
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,347
Give us a hand mate.

22
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:27,361
- All ready Captain.
- Down she goes.

23
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,201
What are you waiting for?

24
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:39,261
Well Captain, that chest is been
in your cabin a longish time.

25
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:42,512
And we all thought as it would do
no harm to open up that chest...

26
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,420
and make sure that what
was in it then is in it now.

27
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,090
I suppose you remember what was in it.

28
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,621
Aye, I remember an emerald necklace that
came off that Portuguese ship, El Vengar.

29
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:57,056
And all those pearls that we took
from the big ship, the Virgin Queen.

30
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:02,048
I remember a diamond medallion we got
from that Moorish galleon off Madagascar.

31
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:05,944
And could we ever forget that silver
casket with the arms of Lord Blayne...

32
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,595
that you claimed for yourself after
the taking of the Twelve Apostles sir?

33
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:13,725
Your neck will be stretched as
long as your memory one of this days.

34
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,529
Satisfied, gallows meat? Put them back.

35
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,096
Lower away.

36
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,022
Matter?

37
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,400
Wait a minute Captain,
there's something else you forgot.

38
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:14,535
What do you want to now? We got
an half an hour before the tide traps us.

39
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:17,150
May be sir, we all equal in this I take it.

40
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,478
Equal shares, yes.

41
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:22,558
Well that key then, what you put back in
your belt, that goes down with the chest.

42
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,318
Thus we start all clear and no favors.

43
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:30,064
If some of us don't get back, it'll be
that much easier open for them as does.

44
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:34,552
Question me honor again, would
you? And I'll rip you from belly to chime.

45
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:59,346
Are we such callous rascals
that we'd leave a dead comrade...

46
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:02,870
without commending
his soul to his new master?

47
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:12,941
Here lies one who
through treachery and avarice...

48
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:17,011
would've placed in
jeopardy the lives of honest men.

49
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:22,340
And here may he lie
forever, in the sands of Madagascar.

50
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,745
Rest in peace.

51
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,506
It's time to be out my lads, time to be away.

52
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,583
If a gentleman is a gentleman, he's
gentleman, that's all there's to it, sir

53
00:06:56,584 --> 00:07:00,160
I'm one of nature's gentlemen,
but I need polish my good man..

54
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:01,887
If I'm to improve myself...

55
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:06,638
A gentleman employs the terminology my good
man only when addressing lower servants...

56
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:11,117
- or his inferior sir.
- You see? That's why I need you.

57
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:15,787
- In my upbringing...
- A gentleman never sucks his teeth sir.

58
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:19,146
Many a man's social career
has been ruined by less sir.

59
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:23,423
You seem to know your business.
I want the best mind and I can pay for it.

60
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:25,640
Hundred quid a year.

61
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:28,462
An infallible mark
of the person of quality...

62
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:31,107
is his reluctance to
pay his domestics high wages.

63
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,666
- You don't say so.
- Merely a idiosyncrasy of good breeding sir.

64
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:39,384
Sixty quid a year then?

65
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:42,575
You realize I've never
been on board a ship before sir.

66
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:45,346
- Oh don't let that frighten you.
- To the contrary.

67
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:47,390
In fact, since I was a nipper...

68
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:51,856
I've a rather adventurous inclination
towards life on the bounding main.

69
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:56,140
- It should be quite educational sir.
- You'll learn a lot, no doubt.

70
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:59,850
- Is it a bargain then?
- Very well, sir.

71
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:01,580
My hand on it?

72
00:08:54,665 --> 00:09:00,512
Then, it is your proposal,
my Lord Bellomont that Captain Kidd...

73
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,744
sail to meet our ambassador Lord
Fallsworth and give him safe convoy

74
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:06,874
through the perilous waters of Madagascar.

75
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,084
- May it please Your Majesty.
- Yes.

76
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,619
That need a bold and adventurous man.

77
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:16,847
Bring in this Captain Kidd
while we take the measure of him.

78
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,313
Captain William Kidd.

79
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:37,562
Your Royal Majesty and other Lords..

80
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:44,743
Bellomont, is this your roaring
killer of Spanish buccaneers?

81
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:49,711
Nay me Lord, I'm only a peaceful ship-master
who must do trade with other ships...

82
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:52,342
without inquiring too
closely about their business.

83
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,870
And it was so I fell into the
hands of the Twelve Apostles.

84
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,888
- A King's ship turned pirate.
- In Madagascar waters?

85
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:02,645
I have never been in
Madagascar waters your Grace.

86
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:07,433
It was off the southern tip of Africa, where
I had gone to trade in elephant's teeth.

87
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:12,683
- Who commanded her?
- One of your admirals Your Majesty.

88
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:17,177
- Name of Lord Blayne.
- He did turn pirating.

89
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:23,210
Sufficiently me Lords, to put
fear in honest traders like myself.

90
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,044
And if you are successful in this voyage
Captain, what reward do you expect?

91
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:31,955
May it please Your Majesty,
having forfeited me honor in that I was...

92
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:34,006
forced to strike me colors to a pirate...

93
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:39,359
I want no reward but to regain it
In the service of Your Majesty.

94
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:47,043
Unless it be, is it true that Lord Blayne's
lands are estreated and his title forfeit.

95
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:48,387
Yes.

96
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:55,104
All, well, all I ask is if I lay
this renegade nobleman by the heels...

97
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:01,165
is that you honor the humble self
with his castle and his lands.

98
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:09,674
- Is that all you want Captain Kidd?
- Not a farthing more Your Majesty.

99
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:14,901
The fellow treats of a title so lightly
he must be bursting with noble blood.

100
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:17,504
Though I confess he keeps it well hid.

101
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:20,957
Aye sir, you can no more judge
of a man by his appearance...

102
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,462
than you can judge the extent of a nobleman's
brains by the expensiveness of his wig.

103
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:33,886
Am I to suppose that the Captain of the
King's Guard would deign to fence with me.

104
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:42,613
Come Captain, is
your courage less than your wit?

105
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:46,769
Nay sir, I know nothing of the fence.

106
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,472
You must come at me,
quickly as though you'd kill me.

107
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,674
Very well then.

108
00:11:56,787 --> 00:12:01,423
I ask pardon Sire, I've a hot head
when roused, I only meant to demonstrate.

109
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,435
And to good purpose Captain.

110
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:12,489
Your Majesty is satisfied
with the Captain of our choosing?

111
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,404
- I can think of none better.
- I thank you sir.

112
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:20,010
And now Captain...

113
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:24,117
the main mission of your crew
will be to meet a great ship.

114
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,880
The Queda merchant, which is
sailing from India with vast treasures.

115
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:30,985
And to give her safe conduct in my name...

116
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,699
past the perilous waters of Madagascar.

117
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:38,901
But Your Majesty, will her commander accept
me letter of mark as sufficient authority to.

118
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:42,931
You shall have a letter to our ambassador
Lord Fallsworth who's returning in her.

119
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:45,698
That he is to accept your protection.

120
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:50,468
And to submit to all matters
pertaining to the safety of the ship.

121
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,712
- And her treasures Sire.
- Oh yes.

122
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:59,418
- And now Sire, me crew...
- Your crew?

123
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,873
Captain Kidd who wishes
to recruit a crew from the pirates...

124
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,970
now under capital sentence
in Newgate and the Marshal sea.

125
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:11,040
- A crew of condemned pirates?
- Aye Sire.

126
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:15,906
There's none would be
so loyal nor fight so desperately...

127
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:18,354
as cutthroats under sentence of death...

128
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:21,878
If they knew that at the end of the voyage...

129
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,515
a Royal pardon would be in their pockets.

130
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:29,384
But I shall hold you
accountable for their good conduct.

131
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:33,976
Between their conduct and mine Your
Majesty, there will be little to choose.

132
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:35,710
And now goodbye.

133
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:43,390
- And God speed you.
- I am but his unworthy sparrow.

134
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,169
I'd rather eat the bilge
slime from an African slaver.

135
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,820
Oh Adam, don't let your
temper get you the lash again.

136
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,671
If I must hang I'll hang, but I'll go
to the gallows with clean guts at least.

137
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:29,538
Hey you, what kind of
stinking maggots meat is this?

138
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,116
Wardens, wardens.

139
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:35,396
There's that dainty scum Mercy complaining
about the taste of the King's bounty again.

140
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:36,811
- Watch it.
- Bounty?

141
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:37,696
Bounty me eye.

142
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:41,735
The King's allowance is thru-pence a day for
food not muck from the sewers of Whitechapel.

143
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:43,622
Making trouble again, hey Mercy?

144
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:46,276
I'm asking only what
a man is legally entitled to.

145
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,900
Here, smell this.

146
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,360
Delicious.

147
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,487
Hear you Guvnor.

148
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:09,697
What sort of a kingdom is this?

149
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:13,824
Where a man is condemned before he's
heard and starved before they hang him.

150
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,794
Who is that quarrelsome feller?

151
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:19,514
Adam Mercy, he is taken in a
pirate ship by his Majesty's frigate Wasp.

152
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:22,748
He's always escaping so
that's why we keep him in chains.

153
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,696
He's got a lacing of tiger's blood in him.

154
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,738
This ain't exactly a flower garden, is it?

155
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:36,270
Oh, forgive me, these are two of
me officers Mr Boyle, Guvnor Landers...

156
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,367
Mr Lorenzo, Guvnor Landers.

157
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:41,514
Spanish blood.

158
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,690
- A pretty lot of sinners.
- Capitán...

159
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:48,017
Do you think there is
anyone down there knows us?

160
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,486
I hope not.

161
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,940
Guvnor, would you be good enough
to tell them what we are here for?

162
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,424
Give heed you, you vermin.

163
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:58,872
Here news to your advantage.

164
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:02,382
- Is the hangman dead then?
- Out with it then, Jack nasty face.

165
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:05,012
Is it that your mother's
turned into an honest woman?

166
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:06,452
Silence, you mutinous dogs.

167
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,633
If another man speaks I'll trice him
up by the thumbs and flay him raw.

168
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:18,227
Guvnor, is that the way to win the
love of these unfortunate gentlemen?

169
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:23,248
Now then me bullies, would
you rather do the gallows dance...

170
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,808
and hang in chains till the crows
pick your eyes from your rotting skull...

171
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:33,346
or would you feel the roll of
a stout ship beneath your feet again?

172
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,074
I've a vessel, the Adventure galley
and the King's commission to sail her.

173
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:45,976
And for those who show a loyal and a stout
heart there's a Royal pardon in the offing.

174
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,115
Which of you knows the waters of Madagascar?

175
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:56,325
- I do.
- Would you have him unlocked Guvnor?

176
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,060
Warden, unlock him.

177
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:08,647
Look you then, I want men with iron in
their blood and steel in their sinews.

178
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,808
And the first up here is the first enlisted.

179
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,459
Guvnor, if your wardens are ready, would you
be good enough to have them lower the ropes.

180
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,984
Lower away.

181
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,186
Here they come, make ready lads.

182
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,694
Put your hands on that,
I'll make you a free man.

183
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:52,218
The other now.

184
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:57,204
Next.

185
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:10,717
Next one, come on.

186
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:18,213
- Name.
- Philip Shaftstow.

187
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:21,640
Philip Shaftstow, regardless
of the fact that I'm your Captain...

188
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:25,068
you will always address
a gentleman as sir scum.

189
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:27,983
- Aye sir.
- Make your mark.

190
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:35,487
On board.

191
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,335
- Name.
- Adam Mercy sir.

192
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:40,206
Oh, so it's you.

193
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:46,235
Mercy, that's a comical handle
for a blade of fortune, Mercy.

194
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,810
It's also something the world needs more of.

195
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,698
A quite and gentle
philosopher, you speak cultured.

196
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:55,288
Were you by any chance
a stable boy to a noble house?

197
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:56,615
Perhaps.

198
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:01,805
I was also Master Gunner to a buccaneer
you may have heard of, Captain Avery.

199
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:04,845
Avery's Master Gunner?

200
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,927
We needed a Master Gunner
Mr Boyle and from what I've heard...

201
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:11,957
Avery was a shrewd hand at picking them.

202
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,575
The berth is yours
for as long as you can handle it.

203
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:18,171
I can handle it.

204
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,608
Swivel gun or long arm,
I'll forfeit a guinea for every miss.

205
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:25,777
You'll forfeit your neck if you miss
while you're on my ship. Make your mark.

206
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,195
And you can write.

207
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:38,408
We'll give you a nice bath, you'll
draw a uniform befitting a Master Gunner.

208
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,593
- On board.
- Next man.

209
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:42,911
- Name.
- Bartholomew Blivens sir.

210
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:48,028
Bartholomew Blivens, make your mark.

211
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,950
Down below.

212
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,180
- Captain aboard?
- He's over there sir.

213
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,070
Next man.

214
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,495
That's all sir, our complement is full.

215
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:35,603
- Povey? I thought you...
- Yes, you thought I was dead.

216
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:50,135
- I can hardly believe my eyes.
- You mean you don't want to believe them.

217
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:53,064
Now come, come Mr Povey,
is that kind or is that fair?

218
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:56,344
As fair as what you did the day
you abandoned me on a Bahama reef.

219
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:59,174
Oh please Mr Povey, this
not the time to talk about that.

220
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,726
Oh, it's the time alright,
unless you want me to know.

221
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:07,005
In which case your present
voyage is over before it's begun.

222
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:11,508
Now, now, now, now, Povey.
Mr Boyle, would you take over, please?

223
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,712
Mr Lorenzo, take the deck watch.

224
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,580
Come to my cabin.

225
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:45,589
My heart bleeds
when I think of one of your...

226
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:50,120
delicate constitution having to fend
for yourself on a coral reef Mr Povey.

227
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,250
Come off it Captain.

228
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,911
I know why you marooned me.

229
00:21:57,728 --> 00:22:01,028
You thought there'd be only three
of you to share, instead of four.

230
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:05,447
It's true, a hostile wind did
blow us away from your reef.

231
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:10,117
Between friends, we might've sailed back,
it's exactly what you would've done Mr Povey.

232
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:14,097
So no more of your
sentimental nonsense please.

233
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:22,855
- Now that we are four again, what then?
- We are not four.

234
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:28,460
We are two, Boyle and Lorenzo, dull clods.

235
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,066
Twenty thousand pounds a piece in their
hands would only be spent in sinful ways.

236
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:38,776
Are you propose to remove
them from the path of temptation.

237
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,233
How? A knife in the dark?

238
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:45,791
I am not a violent
man Mr Povey, I detest violence.

239
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:49,236
People have such an
awkward habit of getting in my way.

240
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:54,875
I'm an ambitious man Mr Povey.

241
00:22:54,905 --> 00:23:00,631
An ambitious man, if he be bold
enough, can carve himself a kingdom.

242
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,301
I'm going to be a Lord my friend.

243
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:08,563
And that for a commoner
like myself takes a deal of money.

244
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:13,486
And that's why there
could be two less to share.

245
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:18,857
- Before we raise old England again?
- You cold-gutted shark.

246
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,246
A flatterer.

247
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,841
Oh, I'm glad you're back in Mr Povey.

248
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:34,635
You've no idea how gratifying it is
to have a congenial soul to confide in.

249
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:37,206
Thank you.

250
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:40,839
There's something I want to tell you.

251
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:45,562
I've left with a trusted friend in London
a sealed letter containing an exact...

252
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:47,913
and complete account
of certain previous events.

253
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:51,148
Only to be open in
case, just in case of course...

254
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:54,408
you should happen
to return to England without me.

255
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:59,705
Of course my dear
fellow, very sensible of you.

256
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:06,435
Now I know you'll
have a happy voyage. I shall too.

257
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:19,985
I'll look up me quarters.

258
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,493
We are two of the
luckiest man alive, just think...

259
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:51,213
We are sailing for Madagascar waters,
we'll pick up the search where we left off.

260
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:54,015
Every officer on board has a servant.

261
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:57,366
I'll request the Captain to assign
you to me, then we'd be together.

262
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,578
Yes, I've spent a good
many years of my life at sea Milady...

263
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:13,048
But I doubt if any woman minds a dash of
salt even in a Peer of the Realm like myself.

264
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:17,272
Now, if Me Lady would join me in a minuet?

265
00:26:17,302 --> 00:26:21,131
- My Lady sir, not me Lady.
- Blast me Shadwell.

266
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:27,019
Does one gentleman creep up on another without
a cough or a spit or something to warn him?

267
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:30,880
I'm not a gentleman sir,
I'm a gentleman's gentleman.

268
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:37,129
Pity about the hair.

269
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:45,154
I have you've tried everything?
Bear's grease?

270
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,252
Prenatal influence perhaps?

271
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:54,864
Dinner is served, sir.

272
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:58,612
- Thank you Shadwell.
- Pardon sir.

273
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:00,430
I'll show you to your place.

274
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:10,151
Captain, what's all this mummery?

275
00:27:10,181 --> 00:27:13,771
You can forget your bilge-water
manners for the time, Mr Boyle.

276
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,053
You are now officer on a King's ship.

277
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,346
So a man must starve
while his manners fatten.

278
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,103
I know, I know.

279
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,630
And in a King's ship it is customary for the
officers to rise when the Captain enters.

280
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:48,161
That's better. Gentlemen be seated.

281
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Well, well, well, what have we here?

282
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:11,018
- You must not do that sir.
- Of course, but don't press me.

283
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:47,316
Come Mr Mercy, tell us
something about yourself.

284
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:50,649
You already know
whatever's of consequence sir.

285
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,338
While under Avery I was taken by a
King's ship and brought to London.

286
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,904
There I was tried for a pirate and condemned.

287
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,090
You were innocent, of course.

288
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,307
- No sir, I was guilty.
- You speak above your station.

289
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:09,439
- How came you to go on the account?
- Call it love of adventure...

290
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:12,585
cost in love, scandal,
perhaps a mix of all three.

291
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:15,317
And you've seen something of the world?

292
00:29:16,512 --> 00:29:20,412
Enough sir, to dislike what I've seen and
know there's small hope for a better.

293
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:24,291
Perhaps you prefer the next world Mr Mercy.

294
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:28,559
You were close enough to it when you
were in the condemned hold at Newgate.

295
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,814
But I'm keeping you from your dinner.

296
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,982
And now gentlemen.

297
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,355
A toast to the King and since proposing
it is a privilege of the youngest present...

298
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:59,341
the honor falls to Mr Mercy.

299
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:06,403
- Mr Mercy, we are waiting.
- No sir.

300
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:10,789
Since I've little love for the King, I'll
neither propose his health nor drink it.

301
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:13,495
Never the less you are on a King's ship.

302
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:17,395
King's ship or the devil's it's all the
same to me sir, I owe him nothing.

303
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:22,093
You owe him your neck
Mr Mercy, if it were not for his bounty...

304
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:25,698
you'd be dancing daintily on air at Wapping.

305
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:30,987
I owe my reprieve to you Captain, so
to you I'll drink gladly but not to William.

306
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:35,751
You stand up and drink to his Majesty's
health as a King's officer should...

307
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:41,252
or by fire and flame I'll have you shipped
back to Newgate on the first vessel we speak.

308
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,165
Gentlemen, the King.

309
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:52,862
- The King.
- God bless him.

310
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:15,433
It's curious.

311
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,178
Do you suppose His Majesty
put him on board to spy us out?

312
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,841
We've found him
chained to a pillar in Newgate.

313
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:26,188
Wouldn't be to hard for
the King to plant him there.

314
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,944
Yes, but why would he speak
so openly against the King?

315
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:33,939
Your wits are even
duller than usual Mr Lorenzo.

316
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:36,364
Have you never heard of the serpent...

317
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:40,257
that takes the color of it's
background the better to strike?

318
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:45,959
- Shadwell...
- Yes sir.

319
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:51,062
You have a knowledge of high
born people and those of the courtship.

320
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:55,775
- Have you ever seen Mr Mercy before?
- Not before this voyage, sir.

321
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:59,896
He has as high a spirit as
a gentleman of quality, I like him.

322
00:31:59,926 --> 00:32:03,698
Would you find out
who he is and where he comes from?

323
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:06,342
- As you wish sir.
- Thank you Shadwell.

324
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,662
- Foggy night.
- Good evening, Shadwell.

325
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:35,863
Excuse me sir but you seafaring men
always seem to be looking at something...

326
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:37,227
that I never can see...

327
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,600
We are looking for
something just over the horizon.

328
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,522
You know sir, I recognized you for
a gentleman the moment I saw you sir.

329
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:47,453
What are you a valet doing at sea?

330
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:52,833
The Captain employed me to
make him socially acceptable sir.

331
00:32:53,795 --> 00:32:57,732
I'm afraid we're too
far out for me to swim back.

332
00:32:57,762 --> 00:33:01,908
- If I can be of service to you sir.
- Did the Captain send you here?

333
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:03,877
- Yes sir.
- Why?

334
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,813
He wants to know who or what you are sir.

335
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:09,957
Who do they think I am?

336
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:14,481
Possibly a spy
placed on board by His Majesty.

337
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:16,668
This seemed uneasy sir.

338
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:23,847
This, this Captain Kidd, how long have you
known him? Have you sailed with him before?

339
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:31,666
Oh, no sir. All I know is, he's
a, well, among other things...

340
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:33,737
a merchant captain.

341
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:38,730
A spy, that's strange.
Why should they be afraid to be spied on?

342
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:43,767
- Goodnight Shadwell.
- Good night sir.

343
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,862
- Who is he? Where is he from?
- He's a nobody, sir.

344
00:33:57,184 --> 00:34:02,066
He was employed by persons of quality in
where he learned his speech and his manners.

345
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,848
It's a matter of judgment.

346
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:40,568
If you fire on the up-roll,
the shot will go over his yardarms.

347
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:44,345
But if you wait for the down roll,
the enemy is coming up. Now watch.

348
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:55,030
Get ready.

349
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:00,822
Fire.

350
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,178
Pretty shot Mr Mercy.

351
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,535
Can you do as well with a 74
throwing grape and canister at you?

352
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:14,919
I've done it sir.

353
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:19,349
Reload and secure and pick up your
practice on the lower quarter swivel gun..

354
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:20,767
Mr Mercy?

355
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,571
If you sailed with Avery,
you must know these waters.

356
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:25,382
Fairly sir.

357
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:29,257
If we needed to careen and take on
stores, where would you recommend?

358
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:30,520
Ponticos Bay, it lies...

359
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,694
We draw to much water,
you remember Captain...

360
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:35,879
Remember what?

361
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,287
I only know the Spanish main,
these are Madagascar waters.

362
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:41,403
- Ponticos Bay?
- Aye sir.

363
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,815
Thank you Mr Mercy, come along Mr Boyle.

364
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:54,053
You blundering ass.

365
00:35:55,384 --> 00:36:02,179
Your presence is becoming increasingly
irksome to me, get you below.

366
00:36:32,873 --> 00:36:36,068
Now let's get down
to the business of this voyage.

367
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:39,089
Hand me that chart Mr Boyle.

368
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:45,915
Capitan, I have been thinking
every day and every night.

369
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:49,199
What about that dinero
that was buried in the cave?

370
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:52,729
What good is it there? Let's get it
and get back where we can spend it.

371
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,412
- It stays where it is for a while.
- Why?

372
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:59,270
We've got a fatter prize
sailing right into our pockets.

373
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,003
Now.

374
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:07,282
Here is our present position,
here is Madagascar, here is Calicut.

375
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:11,237
In June, the great
galleon, the Queda Merchant...

376
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,818
sails from Calicut to England.

377
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:18,072
We should meet her about here.

378
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:23,889
She's stuffed from keel to gunnels with
treasure to the value of half million pounds.

379
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:24,641
Half...?

380
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:30,672
And we are to give her
safe passage through the pirate seas.

381
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:34,169
By safe passage you mean
we are to take her Captain?

382
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:37,858
No no, don't be greedy Mr Povey,
I grant that most of what's in her may...

383
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,917
find it's way into our
pockets but let's be fair, the King...

384
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:45,289
poor gentleman, will expect
something. But however we do it...

385
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:50,271
must be done legal like and honest.

386
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,577
Stick to ways you are familiar with.

387
00:37:52,857 --> 00:37:56,957
Why, you pox riddled villain I can be as
honest as any man if I have the incentive.

388
00:37:56,958 --> 00:38:00,708
Oh yes, me Lord Blayne.

389
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:05,350
Lord Blayne's name is not be
mentioned among us Mr Povey, he's dead,

390
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,639
so his crew and so's ours
and there's none outside this...

391
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:10,999
cabin that knows what became of them.

392
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:16,572
And if you all enjoy
living, you will remember that.

393
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,656
Well.

394
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:22,242
Here's to our meeting
with the Queda merchant.

395
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:25,315
- Queda merchant.
- Queda merchant.

396
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:29,156
- God bless her.
- Dios la bendiga.

397
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:20,728
Wind fresh from West North-West, sir.

398
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:23,665
Course Northeast
by East, night dark but clear.

399
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,442
Very well, Mr. Mercy.

400
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:41,105
- North-East by East.
- North-East by East sir.

401
00:40:13,717 --> 00:40:16,784
Missing down, it's Mr Boyle.

402
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,509
Lend a hand men.

403
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,541
Man down.

404
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:26,909
- What happened?
- He is dead.

405
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:33,487
If I find the man that's
responsible for this, I'll hang him.

406
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:38,966
Fetch the yard and re-set it.

407
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:52,111
- What do you suppose happened?
- Someone's been tampering with this lines.

408
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:20,520
We are gathered together to pit farewell
to a gallant seaman and a stout comrade.

409
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:23,974
Here was a man, shipmates...

410
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:28,547
Whose heart, the flinty
mountains could not match.

411
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:31,582
Who always took better than he gave.

412
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:34,309
Whose benevolence was such...

413
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:40,268
The orphan's might and the rich man's
gold alike found refuge in his pocket.

414
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,572
A jealous Providence
has removed him from oust.

415
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:48,528
And I esteem it a privilege
to commit his body to the deep.

416
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:52,090
We shall all mourn him.

417
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:58,962
Aye, we shall mourn him but take comfort me
friends, we shall never see his like again.

418
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:04,234
Rest in peace. Pop him over.

419
00:42:07,185 --> 00:42:10,791
Pity Mr Mercy, a great pity,
but the ship's work must go on.

420
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:15,133
Move your gear into poor Mr Boyle's
cabin, you will take his place as Master.

421
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:17,155
As Master.

422
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:20,378
Aye sir.

423
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,242
Why, Shadwell.

424
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:58,773
Don't tell me after all this time at sea...

425
00:42:58,774 --> 00:43:01,891
My inward revolt is not for
the movement of the vessel sir...

426
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:04,316
is occasioned by the company I endure.

427
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:08,184
The manners I say nothing of sir.

428
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:10,232
But I am a Dorcestershire man...

429
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:13,440
and when I find a common
ship's master is the presumption...

430
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:17,333
to copy himself the coat of arms of one
of our best Dorcestershe families...

431
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:19,953
can you wonder if I'm physically upset?

432
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:24,121
- Whose crest was he copying?
- Credit it or not sir, the Blayne crest.

433
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:25,817
Are you certain?

434
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:31,184
Perfectly sir, the crest in on Orange desk's.
Pardon me sir, I must join the captain.

435
00:43:31,214 --> 00:43:36,184
He's inspecting a cask
of pickled eels with Mr Lorenzo.

436
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:11,865
Well, Mr. Mercy.

437
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:17,124
Do your new duties include robbing my desk?

438
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:21,935
Shoot me Captain and your head
goes with it, I'm here by the King's order.

439
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:25,068
So he did plant you on board.

440
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:28,635
You think he let a man sail with a crew of
Newgate cut-throats and not keep tabs on him?

441
00:45:28,636 --> 00:45:29,915
And with good reason,.

442
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:33,817
If anything ever reaches the Palace
this does and murder Captain.

443
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,502
Boyle's death was no accident.

444
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:41,928
By the way, what ship was
sunk here, the Twelve Apostles?

445
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:45,142
Why the Twelve Apostles Mr Mercy?

446
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:51,052
Here's Blayne's ring, his name is on it,
he commanded the Twelve Apostles.

447
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,532
That will make interesting telling
in London when we get back Captain.

448
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:58,612
- If you get back.
- When I get back, for if I don't...

449
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:04,310
- On the other hand...
- On the other hand, what?

450
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,107
Since a man doesn't
exactly grow rich in the King's pay...

451
00:46:10,428 --> 00:46:15,428
A crooked rogue, so you
have your price, how much?

452
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:19,881
- An equal share in what's buried here.
- Share that with you I'll be hanged if I do.

453
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:26,394
- You'll be hanged if you don't.
- Of all the slumocky blaggards.

454
00:46:28,603 --> 00:46:33,545
And if you do share, Mr King's informer,
what guarantee is there that you won't...

455
00:46:33,698 --> 00:46:35,992
still turn evidence to the Crown?

456
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:38,761
If I go in with you, I am equally guilty.

457
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:41,698
And if we are caught, we hang together but...

458
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:45,909
I can keep you from being caught.
What more could you ask?

459
00:46:48,678 --> 00:46:50,580
You know Mr Mercy...

460
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:56,538
I wondered sometimes if ever I'd meet
a more unscrupulous blaggard than myself.

461
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:01,442
And I have, but let's be sensible about this.

462
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:05,791
Who knows, we might
be useful to each other one day.

463
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:08,283
In one way or another?

464
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:13,157
You've forgotten something, the ring.

465
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,407
So I have.

466
00:47:28,506 --> 00:47:32,756
Listen in carefully because I want you to
tell it in London if anything happens to me.

467
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:35,389
Kidd caught me in his cabin robbing his desk.

468
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,819
I lied to him, told him
I was a King's informant.

469
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,188
Good.

470
00:47:38,218 --> 00:47:41,418
Yes but he didn't believe me,
not one word, he just pretended to.

471
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:45,145
Oh, why didn't you shoot him?
Then he would give us no more trouble.

472
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,773
That's a pleasure I'm reserving for later.

473
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,605
He proves the liar I think him.

474
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:55,215
King's man or no, he betrayed an
uncommon interest in the Twelve Apostles.

475
00:47:55,617 --> 00:47:59,027
I didn't like it Mr Lorenzo,
I mean to find out why.

476
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:01,002
Why, you could've charged him of robbery and

477
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,653
turned off to the
yardarm and all legal and shipshape.

478
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:05,904
You would've
been rid of him once and for all.

479
00:48:05,905 --> 00:48:09,915
Let's not be impetuous Mr Povey.
He can't leave us, unless he swims.

480
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:13,519
It'll be rather amusing
to find out what he does.

481
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,317
You rest easy, leave Mr Mercy to me.

482
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:55,191
Sail ho-ho.

483
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:08,099
Sail ho-ho.

484
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:14,005
- Have the bosun pipe the chorus.
- Pipe the chorus.

485
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:28,108
The Queda merchant, sure enough.

486
00:49:30,703 --> 00:49:33,162
Can you make her out Captain Rawson?

487
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:40,367
She hasn't the cut
of a buccaneer Your Excellency.

488
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:43,372
Much too tidy for that
more like a King's ship.

489
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,001
Yet she has the lines of a merchantman.

490
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:52,387
- Have the longboat ready and manned.
- Longboat off board.

491
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,406
Stand by to putty a shot
across her bows Mr Mercy.

492
00:50:00,436 --> 00:50:01,148
Aye sir.

493
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:03,903
Number four gun crew stand by for action.

494
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,301
She's flying the English colors.

495
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:14,015
Perhaps she is our escort ship.

496
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,670
It was about here we were to meet, wasn't it?

497
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:19,315
Though we make it certain just the same.

498
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:22,755
Mr Gillian, see that
all hands are at their stations.

499
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:24,140
Very good, sir.

500
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:31,836
Ready? Fire.

501
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:35,887
Well placed Mr Mercy.

502
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,859
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard.

503
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:40,629
Starboard she is sir.

504
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:54,019
You will come across with
us in the longboat Mr Mercy.

505
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:58,448
And pay my compliments to all officers,
who will dress as befitting a King's ship.

506
00:50:58,449 --> 00:50:59,752
Aye sir.

507
00:51:13,345 --> 00:51:18,065
Captain William Kidd of his Majesty's
privateer Adventure at your service sir.

508
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:24,184
Mr Povey me surgeon,
Mr Mercy me master, Mr Lorenzo me navigator.

509
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,440
Welcome aboard gentlemen, I'm Captain Rawson.

510
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:32,292
I'm Lord Fallsworth, his Majesty's
ambassador at the court of the Grand Mogul.

511
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,089
Your obedient servant sir.

512
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:39,553
I've been sent to give you convoy and
we better make haste with our business.

513
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:44,632
These are unhealthy waters, the ship could
be hove to, as I discovered a day or so ago.

514
00:51:44,662 --> 00:51:47,321
You mean you sighted
some of the pirate brotherhood?

515
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:50,394
More than that sir, we beat off two of them.

516
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:54,631
Avery and Culliford, out of Last Hope,
some thirty leagues South of here.

517
00:51:55,414 --> 00:51:58,652
Oh stop there, I nearly forgot,
could you spare us some powder.

518
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,932
For we used more then expected in the action?

519
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:02,933
Why, all that you need sir, and welcome.

520
00:52:02,934 --> 00:52:05,241
Mr Lorenzo here could attend to that then?

521
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:08,971
Oh Mr Gillian, take Mr Lorenzo below
and see to that he gets what he wants.

522
00:52:08,972 --> 00:52:10,523
- Aye aye sir.
- Captain.

523
00:52:27,573 --> 00:52:30,873
I'll send for the master gunner,
he'll take care of all your needs.

524
00:53:00,537 --> 00:53:02,173
Mr Lorenzo.

525
00:53:09,175 --> 00:53:11,411
Take this powder and put it in the longboat.

526
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:12,670
Aye aye sir.

527
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:26,837
Gentlemen, my daughter.
The Lady Anne Dunstan.

528
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:31,566
Captain Kidd, Mr Povey, Mr Mercy.

529
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:41,130
- Haven't we met before?
- I think not, My Lady.

530
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,957
You remind me of someone I've seen.

531
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:48,110
I think it impossible
that we could have ever met.

532
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:50,924
Perhaps.

533
00:53:52,808 --> 00:53:54,776
How do we proceed now, Captain?

534
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:58,163
Well, I'm instructed to give
you protection past Madagascar.

535
00:53:58,545 --> 00:54:01,659
And you'll be safe as
long as we sail in company.

536
00:54:02,068 --> 00:54:06,849
But Avery will be a wolf at your heels and
if we are separated in darkness or storm...

537
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:09,607
And what would you advise then, sir?

538
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:11,629
Well...

539
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:15,952
I suppose we could take
Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne...

540
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:20,971
aboard the Adventure of Madagascar
and then if we are separated and this...

541
00:54:21,264 --> 00:54:25,110
- vessel should be taken...
- What about the treasure on board?

542
00:54:25,372 --> 00:54:27,243
One silver chest alone.

543
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,075
A present to
His Majesty from the Grand Mogul.

544
00:54:30,105 --> 00:54:34,289
Contains precious gems
valued at more than a million pounds.

545
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,103
May I suggest, your Excellency...

546
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:41,750
Now, why not transfer the treasure
chest with yourself and Lady Anne...

547
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:44,733
on board the Adventure
until we are out of danger?

548
00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:50,118
- She is a King's ship.
- That is a great responsibility.

549
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:54,929
And although my instructions are
that you are to trust me in all matters...

550
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,975
- I don't know if I could go so far as...
- What else can we do?

551
00:54:59,578 --> 00:55:03,570
Three of them against us?
Or even two sir, we'd be helpless.

552
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,108
- It's the wisest course.
- I defer to your Excellency.

553
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:10,951
Now could we inspect the chests?

554
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:13,549
We could have them
slung into our boats along with the...

555
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:17,300
- gear of Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne.
- Why, certainly. This way Captain.

556
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:19,350
No trouble at all.

557
00:55:27,096 --> 00:55:28,378
Hoist away.

558
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:35,875
Mr Povey.

559
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:38,828
I've sent for the manifest Captain.

560
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:43,485
You may check it against the content of this
chest and give me your receipt, if you will.

561
00:55:43,486 --> 00:55:44,834
Gladly, gladly.

562
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:49,659
Oh, there you are Mr Lorenzo.
Have you completed your business?

563
00:55:49,689 --> 00:55:50,932
Almost sir.

564
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,754
Your people have been
most kind Capitan Rawson.

565
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:59,316
There is only one detail
left, it will not take a minute.

566
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,528
Finish it up then,
we must be gone within the hour.

567
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:03,729
Yes Capitan.

568
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,490
- The manifest sir.
- Would you attend to that Mr Povey?

569
00:56:08,493 --> 00:56:10,766
Thank you very much Captain.

570
00:56:47,748 --> 00:56:49,231
Come Mr Lorenzo.

571
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:51,748
You've seen a lovely lady before this.

572
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,581
A tribute to your beauty Ma'am.

573
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:59,106
Did you finish your business below?

574
00:56:59,652 --> 00:57:00,966
Yes Capitan Kidd.

575
00:57:00,996 --> 00:57:02,799
Then we better be under way.

576
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:07,065
Mr Mercy, you will see Lord Fallsworth
and the Lady Anne into the boat.

577
00:57:07,095 --> 00:57:08,254
Aye sir.

578
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,512
Make way for the longboat.

579
00:57:59,015 --> 00:58:01,972
You will have the luggage Mr Lorenzo.

580
00:58:03,264 --> 00:58:05,614
I apologize My Lady for
our poor accommodation.

581
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:08,796
But me valet Shadwell will see
that you are made comfortable.

582
00:58:08,797 --> 00:58:12,321
A pleasure to have your Ladyship
aboard, if you will follow me please.

583
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,551
Why hasn't it happened?

584
00:58:38,004 --> 00:58:41,572
- She's blown up.
- Someone must touch over her magazine.

585
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,340
Send down some boats at once sir.

586
00:58:45,095 --> 00:58:47,347
You ask me to risk men near that?

587
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:53,500
- Let it go.
- Captain.

588
00:58:56,353 --> 00:58:57,430
Papa.

589
00:59:40,555 --> 00:59:42,080
Excuse me My Lady.

590
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:47,324
Your father, may I say how sorry I am.

591
00:59:47,939 --> 00:59:51,421
The captain is requested that you
take your meals in the main cabin.

592
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:55,534
Oh no Shadwell, I can't
bear to face those men. I can't.

593
00:59:55,564 --> 01:00:00,107
I quite understand My Lady.
But the Captain's orders are orders.

594
01:00:00,512 --> 01:00:03,462
Shadwell, you must help me,
there's no one else I can trust.

595
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:06,791
What can I do My Lady? I'm only a servant.

596
01:00:06,987 --> 01:00:11,127
Where can I turn?
I'm so confused and frightened.

597
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,987
I keep thinking of my father
and the others lost back there.

598
01:00:18,871 --> 01:00:22,608
But on this ship wherever
I go, those horrible staring men.

599
01:00:22,914 --> 01:00:26,586
Like Lorenzo, who's always
standing behind me, beside me.

600
01:00:27,548 --> 01:00:29,698
Last night there was a tapping on the door.

601
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:34,300
When I opened it there he
was, the evil smiling face of his.

602
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:38,730
We might've been better along with
those pirates you fought a few days ago.

603
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:44,452
Pirates Milady? We fought no pirates.

604
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:48,547
Well, my father said Captain Kidd told...

605
01:00:53,626 --> 01:00:56,283
Shadwell, what manner of ship this is?

606
01:01:01,387 --> 01:01:04,142
My father was
killed deliberately, I'm sure of it.

607
01:01:05,654 --> 01:01:09,570
That's why I can't bear to face
your Captain, I'd accuse him.

608
01:01:11,575 --> 01:01:14,820
There's a man on board My Lady, a gentleman.

609
01:01:15,156 --> 01:01:16,512
Whom I know you can trust.

610
01:01:18,163 --> 01:01:20,344
- Mr Mercy?
- Yes my Lady.

611
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:26,386
Shadwell, I know I've met or seen
him before no matter how he denies it.

612
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:31,028
His name isn't Mercy, who is he?

613
01:01:31,058 --> 01:01:34,583
All I really know is My Lady,
he is no friend of the Captain's.

614
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:38,637
Perhaps if I ask him, he'll, shall I?

615
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,494
- Oh yes, will you please?
- Yes, My Lady.

616
01:01:53,304 --> 01:01:55,919
I'm asking you again very nice...

617
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,360
My dear Capitan.

618
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:00,954
Your fancy manners
do not impress me Mr Lorenzo.

619
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:07,849
- When do we divide the gold?
- In London, not before.

620
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:12,968
Then look Capitan,
I will make a bargain with you.

621
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:17,065
A bargain? Everybody wants to
bargain with me, you and Mercy.

622
01:02:17,415 --> 01:02:21,477
Farther and farther, who do you think I am,
a stinking sausage merchant?

623
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,466
What kind of a bargain?

624
01:02:23,882 --> 01:02:25,258
The girl.

625
01:02:26,722 --> 01:02:30,131
All my life I have dreamed of
a beautiful woman like that.

626
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:35,944
Give me half of my dinero now and
you can split the rest between you.

627
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:37,999
If you will let me have her.

628
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:44,293
Five on him, he's smitten with love again.

629
01:02:44,577 --> 01:02:48,249
I want her and I'm going to take her.

630
01:02:49,473 --> 01:02:52,476
Whether I like it or not?

631
01:02:56,675 --> 01:03:03,163
With all this treasure on board the
crew is like a barrel of hot gunpowder...

632
01:03:03,675 --> 01:03:07,021
All that is needed
is a word in the right ears.

633
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:10,778
Do you mean mutiny? You're a witness.

634
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:17,812
- He is inciting the crew to mutiny.
- No, no, no, no, Capitan.

635
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:19,860
I was only joking.

636
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:23,071
You have a very nasty
way of joking Mr Lorenzo.

637
01:03:23,548 --> 01:03:28,158
As for the girl, I've my own plans
for her and they do not include you.

638
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:30,139
Get out.

639
01:04:05,414 --> 01:04:07,975
- Who is it?
- Adam Mercy.

640
01:04:09,938 --> 01:04:11,253
Mister I...

641
01:04:34,654 --> 01:04:37,867
- Thank you for coming, Mr Mercy, I...
- My name is Adam Blayne.

642
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:40,248
Son of Lord Blayne?

643
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:45,275
I knew it, I knew.
What are you doing on this ship?

644
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,730
My father was killed and accused of piracy.

645
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:50,825
- Few people believe that Lord Blayne...
- The King did it.

646
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:54,527
That's why I went to sea and turned pirate
three years ago, that's why I'm on this ship.

647
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:56,728
I knew that someday I'd come upon the truth.

648
01:04:57,165 --> 01:04:58,651
And you have?

649
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:04,277
It was Captain Kidd who
killed your father, wasn't it?

650
01:05:05,654 --> 01:05:09,981
Adam I am no fool,
he did the same thing to my father.

651
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:12,843
The fat butcher.

652
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:18,000
It's taken me three years to
track him down, three years of degradation.

653
01:05:18,149 --> 01:05:20,736
Now I got him where
I want him and he knows it.

654
01:05:21,128 --> 01:05:24,387
- You mean he knows who you are?
- He knows something.

655
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,987
That's why you didn't get me to
know you, why you avoided me.

656
01:05:28,017 --> 01:05:30,417
If Kidd knew we
shared this he'd kill you with...

657
01:05:30,418 --> 01:05:33,642
as little compunction
as he means to kill me, if I let him.

658
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,160
What can I do to help?
There must be something.

659
01:05:39,778 --> 01:05:41,418
Forget everything you've seen on this ship.

660
01:05:41,419 --> 01:05:44,085
Play up to him, be friendly.
That way you'll be safe.

661
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,950
Now, when you get back to London,
no matter what has happened to me...

662
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:50,201
Go to the Lord of the Admiralty and the King.

663
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:53,461
You'll be doing me a
great service as well as yourself.

664
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,236
I will Adam, I promise.

665
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:01,285
We're going to have trouble with Lorenzo.

666
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,806
Speaking as a lion who's exciting the tiger.

667
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:07,461
His blood is getting too rich for him.
He'd be the better for a bleeding.

668
01:06:08,794 --> 01:06:11,045
Things are getting a bit complicated me Lord.

669
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:14,951
The King may accept the elimination
of the Queda merchant as an accident.

670
01:06:14,952 --> 01:06:18,058
Maybe even the
sudden demise of Lord Fallsworth.

671
01:06:18,088 --> 01:06:20,176
But what about the Lady?

672
01:06:20,517 --> 01:06:22,967
You said you had
plans for her, do they include...

673
01:06:22,987 --> 01:06:26,914
Mr Povey, the little dear is as safe
with me as if she was me daughter.

674
01:06:26,944 --> 01:06:31,855
My passion is power
and gold, since she suspects nothing...

675
01:06:31,885 --> 01:06:36,825
I'll deliver her to His Majesty along with
his share of the Queda Merchant's goods...

676
01:06:36,855 --> 01:06:41,111
I'll weep appropriately over
the untimely demise of her Pa.

677
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:46,532
Receive the grateful thanks of
me Sovereign and a peerage is mine.

678
01:06:46,562 --> 01:06:47,569
Mi lord.

679
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:53,623
That is your will but that's what I'll have.
And neither man nor devils shall stop me.

680
01:07:01,479 --> 01:07:06,341
- Shadwell.
- Señorita, Milady. Do not be alarmed.

681
01:07:08,268 --> 01:07:11,268
Now that she knows who I am
and what kind of a ship she's on.

682
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:13,369
I think we can count on her to keep ahead.

683
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,170
You stay here till I come off watch.

684
01:07:18,683 --> 01:07:19,683
Help.

685
01:07:39,224 --> 01:07:40,224
Shadwell.

686
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,609
Use your head Mr Povey.

687
01:07:46,914 --> 01:07:51,710
Luck with us tonight, which of either
them would you like to see survive?

688
01:08:42,835 --> 01:08:45,952
Mr Mercy, you did well to protect her.

689
01:09:18,758 --> 01:09:21,908
- Are you alright sir?
- Yes, I'm alright, look after Lady Anne.

690
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:29,359
Adam, what's the matter?

691
01:09:30,855 --> 01:09:34,221
My medallion is gone,
has the Blayne crest on it.

692
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:36,624
Blayne?

693
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,312
Perhaps I can find it for you sir.

694
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:42,612
No, it must've come off just before
Lorenzo went through the port.

695
01:09:43,289 --> 01:09:47,039
- Shadwell, take Lady Anne to her cabin.
- Please Adam, I can't go in there.

696
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,390
You must Anne,
this is serious, it involves you.

697
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:52,067
Remember, no matter what tricks he tries,
you've never seen me

698
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:53,818
before and you don't know who I am.

699
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:56,219
- Shadwell I think...
- Don't worry about me sir.

700
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,984
He never could get
anything out of me and he never will.

701
01:09:59,014 --> 01:10:02,214
It's the only way you'll be safe.
Shadwell will watch out of you.

702
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,950
What about you Adam? What will he do?

703
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:08,030
The same thing he's done
with the others, if he gets a chance.

704
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:08,469
Oh Adam.

705
01:10:08,499 --> 01:10:10,953
Don't worry Anne, at
least I know what to expect.

706
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:12,510
Go now.

707
01:10:14,078 --> 01:10:17,465
Shadwell, if anything does happen,
remember you're to stand by Lady Anne and...

708
01:10:17,466 --> 01:10:20,866
- see that she gets safely to London.
- I'll stake my life on it sir.

709
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:24,183
- I know you will.
- Be careful Adam.

710
01:10:24,366 --> 01:10:25,709
Please be careful.

711
01:10:28,546 --> 01:10:30,087
Come My Lady.

712
01:10:44,797 --> 01:10:47,775
- He's no King's man.
- Who is he then?

713
01:10:48,597 --> 01:10:52,807
Tomorrow we put into the lagoon for water,
while the crew is getting it on board...

714
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:56,067
you and me and Mr Mercy is going to the cave.

715
01:10:56,097 --> 01:10:57,550
You aren't taking him there?

716
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:03,540
I've a peculiar humor to watch my clever
young friend's face when we dig up that chest.

717
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:06,272
Sweet dreams.

718
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,530
Dig fast Mr Mercy, we haven't got forever.

719
01:12:40,797 --> 01:12:42,457
Who might this be?

720
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,828
Perhaps a man that asked too many questions.

721
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,552
Gently now Mr Mercy,
you've came on something.

722
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:13,743
- So it was the Twelve Apostles, hey Captain?
- Yes it was Mr Mercy.

723
01:13:16,619 --> 01:13:19,436
Open it up.

724
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:46,369
- Blayne's.
- Blayne's.

725
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:53,668
He was a brave seaman but foolish.
Did you happen to know him Mr Mercy?

726
01:13:53,923 --> 01:13:58,381
- I've heard of him.
- I thought perhaps you had.

727
01:14:00,281 --> 01:14:01,636
This...

728
01:14:02,816 --> 01:14:06,421
is yours, isn't it?

729
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:10,464
I traded a ring for it.

730
01:14:10,727 --> 01:14:13,655
- One of Avery's men.
- Yes.

731
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:19,380
When I encountered Lord Blayne at sea
I did my simple duty as a loyal subject.

732
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:24,079
A pity he turned
pirate and traitor to his King.

733
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:26,244
Liar.

734
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:14,895
He's meat for the sharks now Mr Povey.

735
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:19,026
The tide closes this place in half
an hour, we've nothing more to fear.

736
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,559
Yes you have Captain, Lady Anne.

737
01:15:21,589 --> 01:15:26,667
It's a long voyage home Mr
Povey and anything might happen.

738
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:36,382
Naturally her Ladyship
is still very distressed sir.

739
01:15:36,442 --> 01:15:39,742
In the midst of life we
are in death Shadwell.

740
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:42,556
- Although me heart...
- My heart sir.

741
01:15:42,586 --> 01:15:46,025
My heart bleeds...

742
01:15:49,986 --> 01:15:53,490
Confound you Shadwell, you've
drove the thought right out of me...

743
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,862
and it was an uncommon pretty one.

744
01:15:56,108 --> 01:15:58,760
- I'm sure of that sir.
- Go to her at once.

745
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:01,740
Tell her she can't
mourn forever and I shall expect...

746
01:16:01,741 --> 01:16:04,732
her to take her meals in the
main cabin with the rest of us.

747
01:16:05,004 --> 01:16:06,165
Very well sir.

748
01:16:09,405 --> 01:16:10,742
Poor lad.

749
01:16:11,089 --> 01:16:14,397
We turned just in time
to see him go over the edge.

750
01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:20,677
Searched for an hour, never came out.
Well, here's to him.

751
01:16:21,236 --> 01:16:23,376
Wherever he is. You filling ill?

752
01:16:26,285 --> 01:16:27,306
Yes sir.

753
01:16:28,215 --> 01:16:30,369
I'll go to my cabin with your permission.

754
01:16:30,662 --> 01:16:33,374
If you wish, it's been quite a trying voyage.

755
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:38,339
What with one little thing or another
but bear up, you'll soon be home again.

756
01:16:54,293 --> 01:16:56,207
I warned Adam not to go.

757
01:16:56,666 --> 01:17:00,403
- No one could've stopped him.
- Was cold bloody, planned, deliberate.

758
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:03,083
The same will happen
to her Ladyship, unless we can...

759
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,669
Adam.

760
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:15,067
Adam, how did you?

761
01:17:16,269 --> 01:17:17,821
If he finds you on board sir?

762
01:17:17,851 --> 01:17:20,401
- I've come back for Lady Anne.
- Oh, thank you sir.

763
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:23,786
I've been hanging on the rudder chain since
dark waiting for the turn of the watch.

764
01:17:23,787 --> 01:17:25,535
The jolly-boat is moored astern.

765
01:17:25,936 --> 01:17:28,786
I've waited along side,
it's secured right down this port.

766
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,603
Bart, get in it then,
flip at under the main cabin.

767
01:17:31,633 --> 01:17:33,743
Well now, get me some dry clothes.
Shadwell, where is the captain?

768
01:17:33,744 --> 01:17:35,579
In his own cabin with Mr Povey, sir.

769
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,536
Examining the silver chest
they brought back on board sir.

770
01:17:38,566 --> 01:17:41,553
My father's chest.
Shadwell, Kidd doesn't suspect you.

771
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,976
Tell Lady Anne to get some things together and
when the coast is clear you come back for me.

772
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:46,027
Yes, sir.

773
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:00,663
- Master.
- Aye sir.

774
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:04,825
Rouse out both watches at daybreak,
we'll weigh on the morning tide.

775
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:06,085
Aye sir.

776
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:22,617
Adam.

777
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:28,701
Kidd doesn't suspect Shadwell, he's staying on
board and he'll be evidence for us in London.

778
01:18:28,702 --> 01:18:31,500
Bart has a small boat
moored astern, we'll row ashore.

779
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:32,491
Then where Adam?

780
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:35,371
Two days journey overland
is the pirate town of Last Hope.

781
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:37,824
It's the most lawless place
on earth but I've friends there.

782
01:18:37,825 --> 01:18:41,046
- Somehow they'll find us a ship for England.
- England?

783
01:18:41,076 --> 01:18:42,925
- Now.
- Come on.

784
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:01,911
Sit down in the bow.

785
01:19:09,073 --> 01:19:14,700
Goodbye My Lady, goodbye My Lord. Godspeed.

786
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:24,687
I'll see you in England.

787
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,620
- Ahoy there, who's in that boat now?
- Come on.

788
01:19:31,986 --> 01:19:33,992
Come on.

789
01:19:48,395 --> 01:19:49,395
Fire.

790
01:19:58,332 --> 01:19:59,332
Thank you...

791
01:19:59,757 --> 01:20:00,757
melord.

792
01:20:09,647 --> 01:20:10,647
Fire.

793
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:14,324
Down the longboat.

794
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:25,182
Bart.

795
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:28,105
Bart.

796
01:20:31,192 --> 01:20:32,557
Hold on to me.

797
01:20:42,556 --> 01:20:45,315
Take her away.

798
01:21:05,368 --> 01:21:09,053
- They're as dead as a mackerel.
- He's gone through.

799
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,283
Now, I guess that's the end of them Captain.

800
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:14,833
And good riddance. Back to the ship boys.

801
01:21:44,752 --> 01:21:48,262
If you are thinking what I think
you're thinking my friend, forget it.

802
01:21:49,228 --> 01:21:52,137
There's the little matter
of a letter I've left in London.

803
01:21:52,626 --> 01:21:54,374
Spoilsport.

804
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:54,791
Captain William Kidd.

805
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:07,881
Greetings Captain, what news
have you brought me from the Indian seas?

806
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:12,033
By your leave Your Majesty, both good
and ill, but mostly very good indeed.

807
01:23:12,295 --> 01:23:15,114
I returned by way
of the American colonies Sire.

808
01:23:15,144 --> 01:23:19,943
So I understood. With the main
points of your voyage, I am familiar.

809
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,548
I wonder if you could enlighten me...

810
01:23:23,578 --> 01:23:28,028
about the affair of the Queens godchild Lady
Anne Dunstan and your ship-master Mr Mercy?

811
01:23:28,268 --> 01:23:30,798
Oh that poor impetuous fellow Sire...

812
01:23:30,828 --> 01:23:35,125
inveigled that bud of innocence
he did, into running away with him.

813
01:23:35,155 --> 01:23:41,983
And catching him red handed in defense of me
very life I was force to dispatch them both.

814
01:23:42,013 --> 01:23:44,680
Rest in peace.

815
01:23:45,329 --> 01:23:49,972
Tell me Captain about the
treasure and the Queda merchant.

816
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,960
Unfortunate Sire, most unfortunate.

817
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:59,877
We shipped that chest when that ship
blew and all souls went heavenward.

818
01:23:59,907 --> 01:24:03,128
Rest in peace to them, ditto.

819
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:05,477
I see.

820
01:24:05,942 --> 01:24:10,340
And after Twelve Apostles and Lord
Blayne, did you encounter any trace?

821
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:16,268
Nay Sire, I can only hope that the weight
of his sins sank both him and his ship.

822
01:24:16,732 --> 01:24:21,294
I see, then how do you explain this?

823
01:24:26,403 --> 01:24:28,342
Whose might that be Your Majesty?

824
01:24:28,372 --> 01:24:32,549
My officers found it on your ship at
Plymouth after you left for London.

825
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:36,920
It bears the Blayne crest with
which I believe you are not unfamiliar.

826
01:24:37,147 --> 01:24:39,861
I've always thought that
Mr Povey, me surgeon, a very wily...

827
01:24:39,862 --> 01:24:42,012
fellow indeed was hiding something from me.

828
01:24:42,018 --> 01:24:44,518
Hiding it in a secret
locker in your cabin Captain?

829
01:24:44,755 --> 01:24:47,596
I hope Mr Povey has
a proper explanation Sire.

830
01:24:47,626 --> 01:24:50,076
Mr Povey was killed
three days ago defending it...

831
01:24:50,077 --> 01:24:52,277
with his dying oath he swore it was not his.

832
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:55,223
Perhaps Shadwell, me valet slipped it aboard.

833
01:24:55,442 --> 01:24:58,092
Might it not have come
from a Madagascar cave Captain?

834
01:24:58,116 --> 01:25:00,616
Time will get me clear about
all this Your Majesty.

835
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:01,748
Enough of your lies.

836
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:03,416
Look.

837
01:25:13,436 --> 01:25:14,648
A nightmare.

838
01:25:15,996 --> 01:25:17,990
Pity you overlooked Last Hope Captain.

839
01:25:18,288 --> 01:25:21,738
We stood on the headland with my
friend Avery and watched you sail by.

840
01:25:21,739 --> 01:25:25,155
May it please Your Majesty I
accuse this man of piracy and murder.

841
01:25:26,633 --> 01:25:29,975
Was ever a gentleman so misfortunate?

842
01:25:30,342 --> 01:25:31,951
Lock him up in Newgate.

843
01:25:31,981 --> 01:25:36,711
He's to be held for the next session of
the court, there to be tried for his life.

844
01:25:38,898 --> 01:25:42,118
Hands off me, you scum.

845
01:25:43,255 --> 01:25:48,220
All I've done was to the credit
and for the honor and glory of England.

846
01:25:50,863 --> 01:25:56,161
So here's me bequest, to
them what hunts what I have hid...

847
01:25:56,416 --> 01:26:04,416
and to their sons' sons, down
trough the endless corridors of time...

848
01:26:05,403 --> 01:26:10,648
Greed, that spawns murder.

849
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:15,989
Hatred, that corrodes the soul.

850
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:22,040
Ambition, the foulest strumpet of all.

851
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,542
Hey Jack, Jack hey, sell me that
hang-rope for sixpence, will you?

852
01:26:26,957 --> 01:26:29,012
Save your money me lad.

853
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:35,550
You can have it all for nothing if
you'd only step up here and wear it.

854
01:26:39,088 --> 01:26:42,221
Hurry up Jack, can't wait forever.

855
01:26:46,474 --> 01:26:50,166
Captain Kidd is dead
My Lord Blayne, his account is closed.

856
01:26:50,749 --> 01:26:54,499
Now, in what manner can I atone for
the injustice I worked upon your father?

857
01:26:54,705 --> 01:26:57,397
Offer you a First Sea Lord? What you suggest?

858
01:26:57,939 --> 01:27:02,606
We have a fine frigate of fifty guns.
Commissioned for American waters Sire.

859
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:06,630
That we sought of naming, the Lady Anne.

860
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:09,669
It shall be a wedding
gift to you from the Crown...

861
01:27:09,699 --> 01:27:12,708
for your loyalty and
service to King and Country.

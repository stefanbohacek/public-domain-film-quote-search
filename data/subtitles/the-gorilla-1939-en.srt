1
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,880
Good night, good night.

2
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,200
That I shall say good night til it be 'morrow.

4
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,000
Good night, good night.

5
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,920
That I shall say good night til it be 'morrow.

7
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
Good night...

8
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,760
Good night!

9
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,320
Help! Help!

10
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,200
Murder! Police!

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,320
Help!

12
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,760
Mr. Stevens!

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,640
Peters, help!

14
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,600
Help! Help!

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,000
Help!

16
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,200
Help!

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,400
Help! It's after me!

18
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Help! Help!

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,000
Please, help!

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,320
Help! It's after me!

21
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,200
Help!

22
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Peters!

23
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,120
Stevens!

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,360
Mr. Stevens!

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,320
Help!

26
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
Help!

27
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,080
Please!

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,120
Help!

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
Help!

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,880
Well, Kitty, what is all this racket about?

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Peters! Oh, Peters! I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

32
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,560
He's here in this house! He almost killed me!
The Gorilla! The Gorilla!

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,480
- It was awful! He'd've gotten ahold of...
- Be quiet!

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,680
- You have been dreaming.
- Oh, no!

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,880
- What's that?
- I don't know. I tell you, I don't know anything!

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,960
Call the police! Call Mr. Stevens!
He'll kill somebody!

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,080
- Be quiet, can't you!
- No, I can't!

38
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,120
I can't stay here or we'll all be murdered!

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,800
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Stevens!

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
- Were you calling me, Kitty?
- Oh, Mr. Stevens!

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,200
We'll all be murdered in our beds!

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
It's that gorilla fellow the papers are so full of!

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,680
The killer! He was just up in my room!

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
Why, now, come, Kitty, you're hysterical!

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh, no, sir, I ain't hysterical! I've seen him
like I said, sir!

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,720
Oh, Kitty, you're imagining things. Just you
go back to bed.

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,480
That's what I said, sir, only there is this.

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,760
The Gorilla's paw.

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,960
Shall I call the police, sir?

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,240
The police? Yes, yes, call them right away.

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,480
Just a minute.

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,160
I'll handle this my own way.

53
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,080
- Yes, sir. Only...
- Only what?

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,040
You're thinking of the time, sir.

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,800
The time?

56
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,200
According to the newspapers, the Gorilla gives
his victim only twenty-four hours notice.

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Oh, nonsense!

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,400
Now you go back to bed and don't worry about this.

59
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,120
- Back to bed? Who, me?
- Or don't go back to bed. I'm not particularly
interested in where you go.

60
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,320
- Oh, but, Mr. Stevens!
- Kitty...

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,920
- Yes, but...
- I...

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,960
Hello?

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Oh, now, come please...

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
Just a minute.

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,440
That'll be all.

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, but...

67
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,280
I wouldn't be frightened like that
if I were you, Kitty.

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Look, you be frightened any way you want.
This is my way.

69
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,880
Hello?

70
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,040
I begged you not to telephone me here.

71
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,480
Yes, I know I promised, but...

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
You gave me until Monday.

73
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,760
Saturday?

74
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
Tomorrow?

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,960
That's impossible!

76
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,800
I can't possibly raise that amount of money.

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
Yes, I know I owe it to you, but..

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,800
A quarter of a million dollars?

79
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,960
Look, please, now...

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,520
Oh, please be patient.

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,600
I have a plan.

82
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,640
But it's only just started.

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,200
Give me time to work it out
and I'll repay you dollar for dollar.

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Hello?

85
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,080
I want to send a radiogram, please.

86
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,160
To whom is the radiogram going, please?

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
Ms. Norma Denby.

88
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,520
'D' as in 'Denver'.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,640
Aboard the S.S. Paris.

90
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,360
'Regret unable to meet you at boat. '

91
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,520
'Mightily important that I see you at my home,
tomorrow evening, without fail. '

92
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,720
Sign it, 'Fondly, Uncle Walter. '

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,640
Read that back please.

94
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,280
I'm Norma Denby.

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,240
Mr. Stevens is expecting you, Ms. Denby.

96
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,880
- May I take your coat?
- No, thank you. I'll keep it on.

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,560
Nice cozy little place your uncle has here.

98
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
He likes it.

99
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
He'd have to live in it.

100
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,000
This way, please.

101
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,080
Well, well, well! If it isn't the prodigal niece!

102
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
Oh, it's swell seeing you again, darling.

103
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,000
And good to see you again, too, dear.

104
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
I took the liberty of bringing along my accomplice.

105
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,400
- Good, I'm glad you did.
- This is Jack, Uncle Walter.

106
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
This niece of mine isn't much of a correspondent.
But the few letters she did write,
they were full of you!

107
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,880
Congratulations, young man.

108
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,600
Thank you, and I hope you'll excuse me
for barging in like this.

109
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,720
Nonsense, I'm delighted.

110
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
I was more than pleasantly surprised
to hear that you set your marriage for June.

111
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,240
Do you realize it's only a month away?

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,560
Well, we decided we didn't wanna
rush things too much, so...

113
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,600
- So we put it off until...
- The day after tomorrow.

114
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
The day after tomorrow?

115
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Does it startle you?

116
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,640
Why... Why, no, no, that's fine.

117
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,160
That's one of the things I wanted
to talk to you about.

118
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,400
But I'm forgetting my role as host.

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Sit down, my dear, sit down.

120
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
We may as well come to the point...

121
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,160
- Perhaps you'd rather talk to Norma alone, Mr. Stevens.
- Oh, no, no.

122
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,280
No, not at all. As Norma's future husband,
what I have to say concerns you, too.

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,360
Now, as Norma knows, she and I were named
joint heirs under the terms of her father's will.

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,320
And until she marries, I'm the executer of her estate.

125
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
But should anything happen to either of us...

126
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,560
Why, then, the survivor is the head of the entire estate.

127
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
And I think that you, Norma, and you, Jack,
as her future husband...

128
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,080
...should know of what that estate consists.

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,600
To that end, I have prepared a record of your estate's holdings.

130
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,400
And I want to talk it over with you both after dinner.

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
But your radiogram said there was something urgent.

132
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,320
Well, if it hadn't been urgent, I wouldn't have sent it.

133
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,400
Well, something's worrying you. What is it, Uncle Walter?

134
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,520
Well, perhaps I'm unduly alarmed, but...

135
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,760
Last night, I received this note of warning.

136
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,120
From the Gorilla.

137
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,400
The Gorilla?

138
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,760
You mean that murderer, the ones the papers
have been so full of?

139
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
I do.

140
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,640
Well, isn't it possible that this is all just a joke,
that someone's playing a prank on you?

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,240
I wish I could think so.

142
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
But, Uncle Walter, why should he or anyone want to kill you?

143
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,960
I don't know.

144
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,280
Oh, it's possible some old enemy of mine...
I bet I made enemies in my day...

145
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,520
It's possible that one of them in a spurt
of revenge has hired this maniac...

146
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,600
...this professional killer, or whatever the Gorilla is.

147
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,720
But this note is exactly like the one that was in the newspapers.

148
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,320
After he murdered that widow.

149
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,120
Still, I can't bring myself to believe it.

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,840
Of course, you've notified the police?

151
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
No, I haven't.

152
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,520
- But, surely, if there was anything in all this...
- I'm taking other precautions.

153
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,040
Peters and I are armed, and in addition, I've
engaged the services of a private detective agency.

154
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
Their operative should be here any moment now.

155
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,920
Well, obviously, this Gorilla is no ordinary murderer at all.

156
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,040
And judging by his past, shall we say, successes...

157
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,440
It is apparent the workings of the police
were a load of bullock to him.

158
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,040
Of course there's a slim chance that, by not
notifying the police, we might upset his plans.

159
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,680
Ordinarily, I'm not easily frightened, but...

160
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
I must admit this whole affair's giving me the creeps.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,840
Well, it's nearly nine o'clock.
Now suppose you freshen up a bit.
We'll talk it over after dinner.

162
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,240
Oh, Kitty, show Denby to the green room,
and Mr. Marsden to my room.

163
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,760
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry, Uncle Walter.

164
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Stevens.

165
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,000
- Yes, Kitty?
- Oh, I know it's customary to give notice...

166
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,280
Why, Kitty, you're not trying to tell me
you're going to leave me?

167
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Oh, no, sir. I'm trying to tell you I have left you.

168
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,400
But, Kitty, you're perfectly safe here!

169
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,680
Besides, we have guests. You haven't the heart to leave me now!

170
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, my heart is willing, but I'm gonna have
an awful time trying to convince
the rest of my body.

171
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,280
I'll bet there's a dead body in every room.

172
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,120
Dead body won't hurt you.

173
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,560
Can't do you any good.

174
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,440
Well? What are we waiting for?

175
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,440
Let's go.

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,560
- Who did it?
- You!

177
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,920
- Who's with it tonight, chief?
- Make a note, then.

178
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,400
Keep doing it every once in a while.
It keeps me on edge and thinking.

179
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:22,160
Right.

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
Now what do you suppose they want detectives for?

181
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,240
I've got an idea. Let's go in and find out.

182
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
You're terrific.

183
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,960
By George, it's Peters!

184
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,320
- Who are you?
- Me?

185
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,400
- Why, I'm Peters, sir.
- Nevermind that, nevermind that. What's
your name?

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,080
- Peters, sir.
- Just a minute, just a minute.

187
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,920
Where were you last night?

188
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
- I beg your pardon!
- Oh, so you did do something.

189
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,800
- I don't like your looks.
- What's that got to do with it? This is no
beauty contest.

190
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,440
- Who's Stevens?
- I am.

191
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,080
- I'm Harrigan.
- I'm Mulligan.

192
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,200
I'm Garrity.

193
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,320
Harrigan? Mulligan? Garrity?

194
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
I sent for you because I need protection.

195
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,880
- My life's been threatened.
- Now, tell me. Any clues?

196
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,160
One very vital one.

197
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,520
This warning from the Gorilla.

198
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,280
That's weird. You got nothing to worry about.

199
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,080
- Mark that down, Garrity.
- Right. How do you spell Gorilla? Two R's or two L's?

200
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,120
Gorilla? Gorilla...

201
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
G- O-R... G! G?

202
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
G- O... Oh!

203
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,920
Gori...?

204
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,760
Did you... did you...?

205
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,280
Did you say Gorilla?

206
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,840
Why, gentlemen, you're not afraid?

207
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,640
- Oh, no. No.
- No, we're not afraid. We just thought
maybe we...

208
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,880
- Thank you.
- The Gorilla coming here?

209
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,560
- It was nice to have met you, Mr. Stevens.
- Quiet!

210
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,520
Quiet!

211
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,440
Ah, yes.

212
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,480
I've already taken the precaution
of arming my servant and myself.

213
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,200
And I think you'll find every door
and window securely bolted.

214
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,040
I couldn't've done better myself.

215
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,720
With that sort of job, Mr. Stevens, you've
got nothing to worry about.

216
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,520
- What's your plan, Mr. Harrigan?
- Well, first we'll take a look around the house.
Come on, men.

217
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,480
Now, you just sit tight, Mr. Stevens.

218
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,640
The Gorilla will get you over our dead bodies.

219
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,640
- Jack?
- Yes, darling?

220
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,320
- Who were those men?
- Probably the detectives your uncle hired.

221
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,320
Jack, I'm terribly worried. What are we going to do?

222
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,800
Well, it seems there isn't anything we can do yet.

223
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,960
Listen, darling. It isn't that I'm trying to appear
skeptical. It's just that, well...

224
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,920
Somehow I can't make myself believe all this.

225
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,280
But that note! You saw the note.

226
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,320
Of course I did. But, still, I...

227
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,960
Look, darling. We'll wait.

228
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,040
We'll wait and see if something really does happen.

229
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,600
But what if it does?

230
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,360
I just don't believe it will.

231
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
Jack!

232
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,440
Excuse me, sir. I try to put your car away.
But unfortunately, there's something wrong with it.

233
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,080
What do you mean?

234
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,240
It won't start.

235
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,960
Excuse me, sir.

236
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
He gives me the creeps.

237
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,280
He doesn't exactly give me an appetite either.

238
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,040
But I wouldn't let him worry you if I were you.

239
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,720
Honestly, darling, don't you think there's any cause for alarm?

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm afraid I don't.

241
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,080
Oh, there you are. Have a sherry before dinner?

242
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,240
Thank you, no.

243
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,440
Uncle Walter, how long have you had that butler?

244
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,600
Not very long. Why?

245
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,480
Well, are you sure he's alright?

246
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,360
I've found him so. Why?

247
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,400
Well, because I...

248
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,080
Dinner is served, sir.

249
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh. Shall we go in?

250
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,000
You'd better drink a little of that, Kitty.

251
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
It'll quiet your nerves.

252
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,360
Why? Can you hear them?

253
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,720
Oh, here, take it.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,240
What my nerves really need is a good, long trip!

255
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,440
Here!

256
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,520
Now, look here, where were you last night?

257
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,800
- Me? Why, I...
- Answer yes or no!

258
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,680
- I was...
- What were you doing there?

259
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,480
- Doing where?
- Well, how do we know?

260
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,120
Besides, I don't like your looks.

261
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,440
Did you ever take a good look at yourself?

262
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,960
- Yeah!
- Yeah, did you ever take a look...?

263
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,440
Here, now wait a minute, you. Where were you last night?

264
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,800
I spent the night with Shakespeare.

265
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,320
Yeah? Where is he?

266
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,440
He's dead.

267
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Dead!

268
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,640
A murder mystery!

269
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Have any idea who did it?

270
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,960
Look, Shakespeare's been dead hundreds of years!

271
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,480
Hundreds of...? This is a fine time to
call us in on the case.

272
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,520
Say, but she couldn't've done it.

273
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
- How do you know?
- She can't be hundreds of years old.

274
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
That's write. Mark that down, Garrity.

275
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,200
Yeah, what do we do now, chief?

276
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,640
Well, you two have a look out there. I'll look here.

277
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,160
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

278
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,040
What's this?

279
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
That's a door.

280
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,960
It leads to the back stairs.

281
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,000
Back stairs?

282
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,440
Well, remind me to have a look up there sometime.

283
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,120
That's an ironing board.

284
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Yes.

285
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,800
It's an ironing board.

286
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,480
- Look, do you want this thing?
- Certainly we want it. Why do you think we iron on it?

287
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,840
Well, I...

288
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,920
Well, here, take it!

289
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,400
Garrity! Garrity! Garrity!

290
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
Come in here! We found it!

291
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
- You found what?
- The mystery.

292
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,680
- Well, that's hash.
- Ain't that a mystery?

293
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,000
- Some very good turkey, chief.
- I'll be the judge o' that.

294
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm afraid, gentlemen, you won't find the Gorilla in there.

295
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Why will we not find the Gorilla in there?

296
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Now, listen you! I've had...!

297
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,800
Let that be a lesson to you.

298
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,520
Perhaps you gentlemen had better look
outside for clues.

299
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,120
Maybe he killed Shakespeare.
Mark that down, Garrity.

300
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,480
Yeah.

301
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,280
Look, how do you get out of here?

302
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,680
That's what I'd like to know.

303
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,320
- Where's the back door?
- In back of you.

304
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,600
In back of me?

305
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,880
Don't you recall that the paper said the Gorilla always
sends a warning to as many as half a dozen people at the same time?

306
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,520
To sorta throw the police off.

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
Maybe that's what he's doing now.

308
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,160
Perhaps it's just a ruse.

309
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,520
Well, let's hope so.

310
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,720
You know, it's wonderful how much more optimistic
a good dinner can make one feel.

311
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
Shall we have licueurs in the study?

312
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
- Walter!
- Peters, Peters, a light, quickly!

313
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,200
Jack!

314
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,840
What is it? What happened?

315
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,520
Oh, uncle, are you hurt?

316
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,320
Why, no. No.

317
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,800
I don't know what happened.

318
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,120
- Look here.
- It seems to have been thrown in, through that window.

319
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Oh, Uncle Walter!

320
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,160
What are we going to do?

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,360
The first thing you're going to do, or
rather Jack is going to do...

322
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,200
Is to take you away from here.

323
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,560
But you're coming with us.

324
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,600
It's him! It's him!

325
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
Uncle Walter!

326
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,920
Who is it?

327
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,560
Oh! It's alright. It's one of those detectives.

328
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
He did give me a turn!

329
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
Did you see that face?

330
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
I bet when he gets drunk, snakes see him.

331
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,560
What's the matter with you, scaring us half to death?

332
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,480
I'm just trying to let you know I'm not the Gorilla!

333
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,960
This is my niece, Ms. Denby, and her fiancée, Mr. Marsden.

334
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,680
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.

335
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,160
This seems to be a bit more serious than I thought.

336
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,360
I just received this from the Gorilla.

337
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,200
A note. Who brought it?

338
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,040
No one brought it. It was thrown in through that window.

339
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,240
Through that window? Ha, through that window!

340
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,080
- He's right!
- Wait a minute.

341
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,160
This is my good ear.

342
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,480
Oh, say, that's right! You can't kid us!

343
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,880
We were outside patrolling the grounds!

344
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,480
What do you mean?

345
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,120
Why, the note couldn't have come through that window.

346
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,320
- Why not?
- Well, I'll just show you. Stand back, ma'am.

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,680
- That's why.
- But it was wrapped around a stone.

348
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,200
It was... a stone?

349
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,760
Well, why didn't you say so?

350
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,600
Anyway, what do you know about this thing?

351
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
Well, I don't know anything about it. We were
preparing to leave the room...

352
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,320
...and suddenly the lights went out and...

353
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,760
...then there was a crash and...

354
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,320
So the lights went out, eh?

355
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
- Make a note o' that, Garrity.
- Fine.

356
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,800
You were outside a few minutes ago. Didn't you see anybody?

357
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,840
Nobody but us. Say, this note says at midnight.

358
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,440
- At midnight?
- Yeah.

359
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,680
What time's it now?

360
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,560
- It's 10:30.
- I got 11:10.

361
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,080
I got 11:30.

362
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,280
It is exactly 11:45.

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,520
Remind me to put some hands on this watch.

364
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,720
- Yes. Well, make a note o' that, Garrity.
- Right.

365
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,520
Now, look. The Gorilla's after Stevens. We'll have
to keep an eye on 'em. Everybody, into the study.

366
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,680
Come on, let's go.

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,760
Who said that if you give a criminal enough rope, he'll hang himself?

368
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,920
- You, chief!
- Oh, that's where I heard it before.

369
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,760
Come on.

370
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,840
Now that you're all here, I don't want anybody to move, understand?

371
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,160
Is it alright if I breathe?

372
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,520
Yes, but come right back.

373
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,240
- Quiet!
- Personally, I don't believe the Gorilla's coming here.

374
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,600
Neither do I.

375
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,160
Why not?

376
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,880
I'll give you three good reasons, pal.

377
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,400
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.

378
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,880
It ain't enough.

379
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,280
Now, look here!

380
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,800
- I don't wanna have no
... Now, wait a minute. I'll handle this.

381
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,760
- Yeah, but you always...
- Yeah, but you...

382
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,000
You've received the Gorilla's warning, Walter Stevens.
You've just five minutes to live.

383
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,040
Oh, Uncle Walter! Jack...

384
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,680
- Excuse me.
- Here, here, here. Now where you going?

385
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,720
- I'm getting out of here.
- There's no door there!

386
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,720
Well, that's alright. I'll make one.

387
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,880
Quiet, quiet everybody!

388
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,560
Did you hear that?

389
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,960
I wish I didn't.

390
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,080
He's up there, men!

391
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,240
- Where you going?
- I say, he's up there!

392
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,520
That's what I thought you said.

393
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,160
Quiet.

394
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
Alright, men. Follow me!

395
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,080
Stick 'em up! I got you covered!

396
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,600
- What happened? What was it?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

397
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,960
Hey! Did you just pass here?

398
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,840
Yes. Yes, of course. I brought the trunk down from the attic.

399
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,000
- A trunk?
- Yes.

400
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,760
Were we here?

401
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,960
I couldn't say.

402
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,480
Well, maybe we're not here now.

403
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,520
Maybe.

404
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
May...

405
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,880
It's two minutes of twelve. What about Uncle Walter?

406
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,160
Uncle Walter, yes... Uncle Walter, we've...

407
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,040
Just going in here... We'll...

408
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,840
Now, everybody!

409
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,640
Stay just where you are.

410
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,160
Mulligan, you watch those doors. Garrity, you watch that one.

411
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,400
Mr. Stevens, you've... got nothing to worry about.

412
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,840
I wish I thought so.

413
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,080
Me, too.

414
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,200
You have one more minute, Walter Stevens.

415
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,520
I can't stand it any longer! I can't!

416
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,360
You've got to call the police! You've got to!

417
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,080
Mr. Stevens, I'm sorry, but Norma's right.

418
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,880
I don't know what this is all about, but certainly if
there's something to it, the police oughtta know about it.

419
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,720
I no longer know what to think.

420
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,360
Perhaps you'd better.

421
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,280
Hello? Hello?

422
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,600
The phone, there's something wrong with it!

423
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,360
Mulligan, Garrity, it's me!

424
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,040
Uncle Walter! He's gone!

425
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Gone? How can he be gone when every door
and window in this room has been locked?

426
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,000
Mulligan, check those windows! Garrity, check that door!

427
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,960
How did you get in here?

428
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,080
Why, through this door, sir.

429
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,680
How can you when the doors are locked?

430
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,520
- I beg your pardon, it was not locked.
- I locked it myself.

431
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,760
- It is locked.
- That leaves us deadlocked.

432
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,160
It would be impossible for me to walk through the woodwork.

433
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,000
Why? Termites do.

434
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,600
Oh, this isn't getting us anywhere!

435
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,360
Now, leave everything to me!

436
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,560
Gorilla ain't gonna make a monkey out of me.

437
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,720
Now, you...

438
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
Come on, boys.

439
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,640
- Where do these stairs lead to?
- To the bedroom.

440
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,480
Mulligan, Garrity, you have a look upstairs.

441
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,680
Marsden, you come with me and we'll
have a look around the grounds.

442
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,960
You two to the servants' wing.

443
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,040
With the Gorilla prowling around? Not me!

444
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,320
Well, alright, then, come with me!

445
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,040
Oh, nevermind. I'll take my chances with the other Gorilla.

446
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,360
But, wait a minute. We can't leave Ms. Denby here alone.

447
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,240
- Well, what are you waiting for?
- I don't know, but I wish I could think of something.

448
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
- Me, too.
- Oh, go on!

449
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,880
- Don't worry, darling.
- Oh, that's alright. I'll do all the worrying.

450
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,600
Marsden, come with me.

451
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh, you first, sir.

452
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,720
Thank you very much.

453
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,840
Why couldn't this've all happened tomorrow?

454
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,120
What difference would that make?

455
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,720
Tomorrow's my day off.

456
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,000
Poor Uncle Walter.
Right from under our very eyes!

457
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,800
I don't understand how he got out of here.

458
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,960
All that's worrying me is how I'm gonna get outta here.

459
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
Oh, it's him, it's him!

460
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,400
I seen 'em! I seen 'em! It's the Gorilla! I seen 'em!

461
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,440
- What's up?
- It's the Gorilla! I tell you! He's in the closet there!

462
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,520
Oh, Jack, I'm so frightened!

463
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
- Come outta there, you.
- Get 'em, Mulligan.

464
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,720
- You heard him, Garrity.
- What did he say?

465
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,960
Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?

466
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,440
Not unless a hallucination has hair on it.

467
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,640
Come on.

468
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,960
- Now, ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

469
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
Is he dead?

470
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,480
- Who's he?
- I've never seen him before.

471
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,240
- Do you know him?
- No, sir. And this is no time for no introductions.

472
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,200
He's not dead.

473
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,560
- Mark that down, too.
- Right.

474
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,960
Come on, darling. We're getting out of here.
I'm afraid now, too. For you!

475
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,760
And I'm afraid now, too, for me!

476
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,880
Oh, Jack, it's horrible.

477
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,520
I don't know what to make of it.

478
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,840
All I can say is the Gorilla's around here somewhere!

479
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,280
And I know Mr. Stevens is around here somewhere!

480
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,200
And if you all look, we'll find 'em somewhere!

481
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,000
- Where you going?
- Somewhere!

482
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,320
Alright, men. Take 'em upstairs.

483
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,640
- Come on, Garrity.
- You! Lead the way.

484
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
I'll take care of 'em. Kitty, get a basin of hot water.

485
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,200
Do you mind if I go outta town to get it?

486
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,280
You and I have a look around the house.

487
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,680
Wait a minute. There's something funny about this.

488
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,200
Kitty said she saw the Gorilla's arm.

489
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,160
We open the closet and find the sailor's body.
Now, how did the body get in there?

490
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,320
And how'd the Gorilla get out without our seeing him?

491
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,360
That's just what I was about to ask you.

492
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,760
Stevens was sitting right here in this chair until
the lights went out.

493
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,880
Gorilla? Night-night!

494
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,040
That's funny.

495
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,320
What's funny?

496
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,720
Nothing. I think I'll have a look around this house.

497
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,960
Have a look around the house?

498
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,960
Yes... and have a look around the house.

499
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,160
Yes. I'll go, too.

500
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,560
Hey, that guy won't talk.

501
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,680
- Why not?
- He's still unconscious.

502
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,600
You're unconscious and you talk.

503
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,560
- Hey, that's great, chief.
- Mark that down, Garrity.

504
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,080
- Right.
- What do we do now?

505
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,000
Well, first we'll have to reenact the crime.

506
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,960
So how do we do that?

507
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,680
Now, let's see. When the lights went out,
Stevens was sitting in that chair.

508
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,080
You're Stevens. Sit down.

509
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,920
- I'm Stevens.
- Mulligan, close the doors.

510
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,120
Hey! I'm Garrity!

511
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,800
You're Stevens! Now sit down!

512
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,520
I'll work the lights.

513
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,560
One, two, three.

514
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,320
Ah, it's no use.

515
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,280
I don't know. It works for Sherlock Holmes.

516
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,560
I don't know why it won't work for me!

517
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,920
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

518
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,760
- He's gone.
- He's gone?

519
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,360
Gone... Garrity!

520
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,600
Garrity!

521
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Now we have two mysteries to solve.

522
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,240
- Look, I've got an idea.
- What is it?

523
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,280
If we can find out how Garrity disappeared,
we'll find out what happened to Stevens.

524
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
That's a very good idea.

525
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
Shoulda thought o' that myself.

526
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,600
Alright, we'll reenact the crime. Sit down.

527
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,280
- But I'm not tired.
- Do you have to be tired to sit down?

528
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,720
I do.

529
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,080
You make me tired!

530
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,520
Well, then, why don't you sit down?

531
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,520
If I sit down, who's gonna work the lights?

532
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,920
- I never thought o' that.
- Yeah, well, sit down.

533
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,160
- Yeah, sit down.
- Sit down...

534
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,400
One... two... three!

535
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:39,960
Mulligan!

536
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Mulligan!

537
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,360
Did you lose something?

538
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,840
Yes, Mulligan and Garrity!

539
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,160
Go over there.

540
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,440
Now, look. Sit down.

541
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,200
Oh, I don't wanna sit down.

542
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
You don't have to want to! You'll sit down and like it!

543
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,320
Oh, alright. I'll sit down but I won't like it.

544
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
What're you gonna do?

545
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,040
What I'm gonna do ain't important.

546
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,000
Well, what am I gonna do?

547
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,960
That's just what I wanna find out.

548
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,520
One...

549
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,520
Two...

550
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,320
Two and a... two.

551
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,080
Two...

552
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,360
Two...

553
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,720
Three!

554
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,840
Did I hear somebody scream?

555
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,600
Well, if you didn't, you ought to have your ears cleaned out!

556
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,560
Say, where's Mr. Harrigan?

557
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,960
The detective! He's disappeared!

558
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,040
Disappeared? What a pity.

559
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,080
Pity? Why, it's entirely...

560
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,040
How did you get in here?

561
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,480
We... Why, you're...

562
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,760
Don't be frightened. You're safe with me.

563
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,280
Safe with you, I?

564
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,600
Who wants to be safe?

565
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,880
Now, look. I'm very sociable.
I wanna go where there's people!

566
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,480
Hey, what's the matter? What's happened?

567
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,800
Look, I'm standing here, and all of a sudden...

568
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,760
Everything goes black.

569
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,840
Next thing I know, I'm here.

570
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,760
That's funny.

571
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,880
Hello?

572
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,920
Hello, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

573
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,800
No, no. You turn on Willow Drive.

574
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,400
Off Highway 22, and hurry, will you?

575
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,240
Thank you.

576
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,320
Look, it ain't human, I tell you.

577
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,680
It ain't human!

578
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,760
What isn't human?

579
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,440
For a guy to be standing here one minute...

580
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,880
...and the next minute, he's gone!

581
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,480
- Who's gone?
- I'm gone, they're gone, everybody's gone!

582
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,120
It don't make sense.

583
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,920
Certainly doesn't. Will you have a cigarette?

584
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,400
I don't mind if I do.

585
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,360
He takes us right from under his very eyes.

586
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,640
Who does?

587
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,840
The Gorilla!

588
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,040
Hey! Who are you?

589
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,120
What do you want?

590
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,600
What are you doing here?

591
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,800
Listen, man. You got me all wrong. I just came in
to use the telephone. You see, my car broke down and...

592
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,880
This phone?

593
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,200
Look, that phone is out of order.

594
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,640
- Is it?
- Yes.

595
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:27,960
Number, please?

596
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,040
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.

597
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,440
Now, wait a minute, you!

598
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,920
You're the guy we're looking for!

599
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,080
- You're the Gorilla!
- Surely you don't think I'm the Gorilla!

600
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,800
I stopped thinking two hours ago.

601
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,640
- But you don't understand!
- I don't have to understand!

602
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,480
- Shall I try?
- No, you've tried enough, not get 'em up!

603
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,840
Listen, you're making a big mistake.

604
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,440
Well, it won't be the first time.

605
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,200
No... alright...

606
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Alright, I got you covered.

607
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,960
Help!

608
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,680
Shake 'em up... shake 'em up.

609
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,040
Help!

610
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,400
Help!

611
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,040
Oh, help.

612
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,600
Help!

613
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,240
Help!

614
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,640
Help!

615
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,440
Help!

616
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,240
Help me!

617
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
What's the matter? What is it?

618
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,840
I got 'em, I got 'em. I tell you, I got 'em!

619
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,200
- Got 'em, where?
- Yes, he... Well, I did have 'em.

620
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,960
Here, get me outta these.

621
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Keys are in my pocket.

622
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
They're right there.

623
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,720
Oh, it was terrible. The Gorilla, the Gorilla!

624
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,360
How'd you get all tied up like this?

625
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,240
The Gorilla, I tell you. It wasn't my fault.

626
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
He came in and hit me.

627
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,120
It was... Did I leave him in there?

628
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,600
I'm Stevens...

629
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,200
Wait a minute! How'd you fellows get in there?

630
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,400
You tell me. What're you doing with those things on?

631
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,720
Oh, look. A fellow walks right in.
It was the Gorilla, I tell you!

632
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,280
- Yeah?
- And starts to use that phone!

633
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,640
But he didn't get very far, not with me on the job.

634
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,680
Lucky thing for him you had your handcuffs with you.

635
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,960
Where is he? Where'd he go?

636
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
See, I'm the victim. How should I know?

637
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,840
Look, boys, I'm telling you, he walked in,
six of 'em. Six big gorillas, they attacked me...

638
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,080
Hit me right on my crown. Look at that lump.

639
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,560
Yeah, look at this lump.

640
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,520
Right there.

641
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,240
These windows are locked.

642
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,480
From the inside.

643
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,720
You're not kidding.

644
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,680
Kidding? With the Gorilla right under my nose
and a ten thousand dollar reward, he says I'm kidding!

645
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,800
Well, are you?

646
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,240
Who belongs to this?

647
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,200
What is it?

648
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,160
- Coat.
- Why, gorillas don't wear coats.

649
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Sure, they do. Fur coats.

650
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,120
There's something screwy about all this.

651
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,400
Look, if there's anything screwy about this...

652
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,000
...it's me.

653
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,120
It's me!

654
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,560
But I'll soon find out. Each of you grab a wall.

655
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,800
What do we do with it?

656
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,760
Mulligan, you take that one.

657
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,440
Marsden, you take that one.

658
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,000
- I'll take that one.
- I'll sit this one out.

659
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
You won't sit anyone out! Grab it!

660
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,280
Now, take it easy.

661
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,240
Alright, now tap, each one of you.

662
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,680
See if you can find some trap doors.

663
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,120
Oh, must be out there. Come on, men, right out here.

664
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,960
Alright, cover the door, men.

665
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,560
What's the matter with all of you? I've been pounding on that door for the last ten minutes!

666
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,120
- Who are you?
- That's right. Who are you?

667
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Nevermind who I am. I wanna know where Walter Stevens is.

668
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,560
Oh, you want to know where Mr. Stevens is, eh?

669
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,560
He wants to know where Walter Stevens is!

670
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,280
Who do you think we're looking for?

671
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,240
I didn't come here to play games.

672
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,800
I wanna see Walter Stevens and I wanna see 'em right now!

673
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,360
You don't understand. These gentlemen are detectives.

674
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Detectives, bah! What are you trying to pull on me?

675
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,880
I talked to Stevens on the telephone last night.

676
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,720
He told me he had a plan to pay his debt.

677
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,280
- Plan?
- Yes, said he'd only just started working on it.

678
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,800
Well, did he tell you what this plan is?

679
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,440
I wasn't interested.

680
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,080
He wants to square up with me here tonight!

681
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,280
When I talked to him, he wanted a couple
of days more to raise the money that he owes me!

682
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,000
Now where is he?

683
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,720
Well, Mr. Stevens' been kidnapped by the Gorilla!

684
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,400
Kidnapped by... Poppycock!

685
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,080
Now, look here! I don't know who any of you are!

686
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,480
But I do know this. Walter Stevens owes
me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars!

687
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,440
And I'm going to collect it! Tonight! Or else!

688
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,320
- Now, wait a minute.
- Don't, buddy.

689
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,760
How do we know you're... Say, who are you, anyway?

690
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,560
I'm one of Stevens' clients.

691
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,520
I have proof that Stevens has been stealing from
his clients' accounts for over a year.

692
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,720
I gave him until tonight to return my money.

693
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,560
And I'm not going to leave this house until I get it.

694
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,280
Yeah, but wait a minute, wait a minute...

695
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,400
I think he's mad.

696
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,960
Jack! If what that man says is true...

697
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,120
- I don't believe Uncle Walter could...
- It's almost impossible to know what to believe, darling.

698
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,280
Yet things are adding up. If your uncle did have a plan,
if this business of sending for you was part of the plan...

699
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,480
Take her upstairs and keep an eye on her. This has gone far enough!

700
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,000
- It's gone too far!
- It's even gone farther than that.

701
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,240
I'll be alright. It's just too much excitement for one night.

702
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,280
Get your hat and coat, darling. I'm gonna see that
you get to town if I have to push the car all the way myself.

703
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,560
I can't go til we find Uncle Walter.

704
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,720
We'll take care o' that. We'll break this case, won't we, boys?

705
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,160
- Won't we?
- Oh, sure we will! Sure!

706
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,240
Like it was walnuts.

707
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,560
- You know, I feel sorry for that poor girl.
- Yeah? What about poor us?

708
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,520
Strange men zooming in an out. Animals running
around like this was a zoo!

709
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,640
Crazy goes on! I wanna go home.

710
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,680
Oh, so you wanna go home? I'm ashamed of you.

711
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,160
I'm ashamed of you!

712
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,960
You wanna take a run off and leave
that girl here to take the blame alone?

713
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,760
- We're detectives, aren't we?
- Are we?

714
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,240
Haven't we looked all over this house?

715
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
- Yes.
- No.

716
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,400
- Where haven't we looked?
- Well, if there's a cellar, we haven't looked there.

717
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,440
- I'm glad I thought o' that.
- Say, this looks like a cellar.

718
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,480
Where?

719
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,560
- It's locked.
- Well, try your key.

720
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,920
Oh, yes, never thought o' that.

721
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,880
Alright, come on, men.

722
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,320
- Anybody down there?
- Uh, yes. We are.

723
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
- Now, look for a switch.
- It's around here somewhere.

724
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,440
Alright, come on outta there, you.

725
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
Come on. Get outta there.

726
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,600
Alright, come on...

727
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,600
Alright, come on outta there!

728
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,080
Mulligan?

729
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,040
- Where are you?
- I'm right here, chief.

730
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,120
Garrity, where are you?

731
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,320
Over here, chief.

732
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,920
Is anybody with me?

733
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
No, you're alone.

734
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,560
Mulligan, Harrigan! Something bit me!

735
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,000
What? First time I saw a mousetrap catch a piece o' cheese.

736
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,120
Harrigan! Garrity! Please get me outta this!

737
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,960
Get me outta this thing!

738
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,080
- Maybe you'd like a ride.
- Oh, come on, Garrity...

739
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,320
Garrity! Harrigan!

740
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,280
Garrity! Harrigan!

741
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,920
Now, don't worry. I'll handle this.

742
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,200
- It's a pleasure.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

743
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,960
Okay, buddy. Come on, bud. Get that raccoon coat off.

744
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,080
Come on! Get that thing off!

745
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,160
Want me to hit you over the head with this thing?

746
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,640
Well...

747
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,360
We've been double-crossed!

748
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,040
Let's get outta here!

749
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,800
- Peters?
- Yes, sir?

750
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,800
What's all that commotion?

751
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
Sounds like our friends, the detectives.

752
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
You stay here with Ms. Denby.
I'll go see what's up.

753
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,920
Cognac, Ms. Denby?

754
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,480
No. No, thank you.

755
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,840
What's the matter? What's all the racket?

756
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
I got him, I tell you! I got him!

757
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:50,805
You got him? Got who?

758
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,720
- Yes, the Gorilla! He's in there!
- He's in there!

759
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,080
- I can hear him breathe!
- That's you.

760
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,360
Well, open it, open it!

761
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,760
Have you men been drinking?

762
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,280
No, but it's a good idea.

763
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,240
What was that?

764
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,600
- Norma, what's happening?
- It's the Gorilla!

765
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,040
Norma, where are you?

766
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,480
Jack!

767
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,320
A couple o' you get after 'em, quick!

768
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,840
- You heard 'em, Mulligan.
- So did you.

769
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,320
Nevermind, then. You take the hall. I'll go this way.

770
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,400
I'll stay here.

771
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,960
- Is something wrong?
- Where were you?

772
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,680
- I just went to get some tea, sir.
- Didn't I tell you to stay here with Ms. Denby?

773
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,320
I'm very sorry, sir. But I thought that perhaps
a little tea...

774
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,200
What right have you got to think? We're not even thinking!

775
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,720
Ms. Denby might've been killed.

776
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,400
It's fortunate she wasn't, sir.

777
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,000
Why is it that something always happens when you're not here?

778
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,320
An unfortunate coincidence, sir.

779
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,520
- What did you find?
- An empty closet with Harrigan in it.

780
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,200
- Harrigan, Harrigan, Harrigan! Wake up.
- Get up.

781
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,920
- Wake up.
- The Gorilla, the Gorilla!

782
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,480
Did you get him? Did you get him?

783
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,520
- No, he got you.
- Well, it won't happen again.

784
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,680
- Okay, men. Follow me.
- Okay.

785
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,040
Follow me.

786
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,360
Go down and see where these stairs lead to.

787
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,600
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

788
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,840
- Oh, me!
- It's awful dark. I shoulda brung my glasses.

789
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,280
- You never wore any glasses.
- That's right. I forgot.

790
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,720
- What's that funny tapping?
- Yeah!

791
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,040
It's my knees.

792
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,560
It's a fine time to be scared!

793
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,600
- You try and think of a better time.
- Yeah, well...

794
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,080
Look, look.

795
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,640
I've had about enough o' this!

796
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,800
Me and the Gorilla's gonna have a showdown right now!

797
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,240
- That's right, chief.
- I'm telling you I can't stand it!

798
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,040
Now, don't argue with me!

799
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,720
I know what I'm talking about!

800
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,040
I'm going in there, and we'll look over this house.
And he'll take orders from me, understand?

801
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,080
I'm gonna tear this house apart!

802
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,480
Tear it limb from limb!

803
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,840
Now, come on, follow me!

804
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,720
I'll show this monk who's a monk!

805
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,760
You fellows stay close behind me.

806
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,920
If anything happens, leave it to me.

807
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,640
I'll do all the talking.

808
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,720
Come on, men.

809
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,840
People here running here to there all day.

810
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,160
All day long. I've never seen anything like this in all my life.

811
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,120
First... Hey, where are you going?

812
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,920
What's eating you?

813
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,000
What've you got there?

814
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,080
That dame musta saw something or she wouldn't
be running away like that.

815
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,680
Make a note o' that, Garrity.

816
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,200
Garrity! Mulligan!

817
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,600
- Good evening.
- Good evening...

818
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,120
- What do you want?
- Don't be frightened.

819
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,960
Frightened? Who's frightened?

820
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,280
Don't you come near me! I'll wrap this
thing around your neck like it was a pretzel!

821
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,520
- There's nothing to worry about.
- That's what you think.

822
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,560
- May I give you some advice?
- No!

823
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,480
If I were you, I'd go to my room and stay there.

824
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,160
Why, yes, sir. I was just planning on that!

825
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,720
Wait a minute. Where have you been?

826
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,760
No place. Honest, sir! I was just getting
ready to go to town!

827
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,880
- Good.
- Don't open that!

828
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,120
- Why not?
- The Gorilla! He's in there!

829
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,640
Don't be silly.

830
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,400
- Get going now. Get going.
- Yes, sir. I'm practically there!

831
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,720
That ain't a man. It's a gorilla. We saw it and we felt it!

832
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,800
I tell you, the Gorilla is a man. I ought to know.
I've read enough about him.

833
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,640
But how could a monkey possibly have
written those notes to Uncle Walter?

834
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,400
Maybe it's got an education.

835
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,800
Poe! Poe!

836
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,440
Poe! Where is he, have any o' you seen him?

837
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,040
- Who?
- Poe.

838
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,960
- Who's Poe?
- Poe's the gorilla.

839
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,400
- The Gorilla?
- Oh, you know 'em, too, eh?

840
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,560
Know 'em? I trained 'em since he was that high.

841
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,280
You're just the one we're looking for.

842
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,280
Don't any of you understand? Poe is a gorilla, a trained gorilla.

843
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,400
- A real gorilla?
- Sure, a real gorilla.

844
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,880
Well, so we don't know what we're talking about, eh?

845
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,080
Yeah, we know a monkey when we see one.

846
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,320
Listen, this is serious. Poe ain't no pet.

847
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,440
There's no telling what he's liable to do when I ain't around.

848
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,680
'Specially with women. He hates women.

849
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,800
Well, what's he doing here? What're you doing here?

850
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,840
We was hired to come here. We're working at the County Fair.

851
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,720
Yesterday, a guy comes along, says
he wants me to bring Poe here.

852
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,360
He says he's giving a party, wants us to put on our act.

853
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,040
- Who hired you?
- I don't know. I don't know nothing.

854
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,520
All I know is I bring Poe here, we're waiting
out in the garage like he tells me.

855
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,080
Waiting to do our stuff.

856
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,040
All of a sudden, somebody gives me a clunk over
the head and I wake up in a lady's boudoir.

857
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,680
But the gorilla... how'd he get loose?

858
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,720
You're asking me! That's what I wanna find out.

859
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,120
Listen, this is serious. We gotta find 'em.

860
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,000
We gotta. Somebody's liable to get killed.

861
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,720
The note from the Gorilla!

862
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,280
Fall against your fifty they were addressed to me!

863
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,840
Notes? Poe can't write no notes!

864
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,360
Even I don't know how to write.

865
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,480
Now, look. The next time I buck up against that gorilla...

866
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,480
I'm telling you, I'll...

867
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,680
Well, I'll...
He'll never know!

868
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,240
He'll do it!

869
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,720
- Listen, have you seen 'em?
- Yes, he's in the kitchen.

870
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,640
- Which way is the kitchen?
- Through the panel.

871
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,040
We'll go with you.

872
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,520
Listen, you fellows better wait here. There's
no telling what that ape'll do.

873
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,200
Oh, Jack, I'm so confused.

874
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,720
A real gorilla, and those notes, and...

875
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,840
Listen to me, everybody.

876
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,040
The Gorilla has done his work.

877
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,000
Walter Stevens is dead.

878
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,600
You will find his body in the garage.

879
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,720
Oh, Jack!

880
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,880
Alright, everybody. Follow me to the garage!

881
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,960
Come on.

882
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,120
- Come on.
- Come on.

883
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,040
He's gone! Poe's gone!

884
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,760
- I tell you, he's in the kitchen!
- The kitchen's a wreck. He must be on a rampage!

885
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,720
Outta my way, brother. I got my own
troubles to worry about.

886
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,960
Alright, all of you! Out in the garage! Come on!

887
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,520
I'll stay here and protect Ms. Denby.

888
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,120
This way, please.

889
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,480
I'll never forgive myself for not calling the police.

890
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,160
Why call the police with us around, lady?

891
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,920
You couldn't save Uncle Walter.

892
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,920
We couldn't, eh?

893
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,560
- Well, you didn't, did you?
- Well, we...

894
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,600
That's right, we didn't.

895
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,960
I gotta find out how that gorilla gets in and outta here.

896
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,480
There must be a secret spring around here someplace.

897
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,960
I think I'll look in back o' these books.

898
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,080
Help!

899
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,440
Help!

900
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,320
Somebody! Get me outta here somebody!

901
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,360
Don't tell me she's the Gorilla!

902
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,000
I told you I didn't like her looks.

903
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,680
- Oh, wise guy!
- Come on, we gotta find the body.

904
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,320
- What'd I do with them keys?
- Look under the mat.

905
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,520
- That's funny!
- Oh, very funny. Will you get me out of here?

906
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,320
Listen, what're you doing in Poe's cage?

907
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,280
What do you think I'm doing, waiting for
somebody to feed me peanuts?

908
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,360
Get me outta here!

909
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,000
Don't you know Poe hates women?

910
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,200
So does Kipling. So what? Will you please
get me out of here?

911
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,640
Alright, don't get excited.

912
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,760
Say, wait a minute. I think this was a trick
to get us outta the house.

913
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,760
Come on.

914
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,440
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm the gorilla's keeper!

915
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,400
- Are you the one that gave me the clunk on the head?
- No, but it was a good idea.

916
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,640
Oh, yeah?

917
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,400
Look!

918
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,320
- He's got her!
- Don't talk! He'll drop her!

919
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,760
Poe! Bring her down, Poe!

920
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,360
Bring her down to me!

921
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,560
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!

922
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
Put her down, Poe!

923
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,400
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!

924
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,400
Poe! Stop it, Poe!

925
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,160
Bring her down, Poe!

926
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Bring her down to me!

927
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,800
Put her down, Poe.

928
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,160
Come on.

929
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,240
Poe, Poe, come back here! Help me catch him!

930
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,240
Oh, thank you, thank you.

931
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,440
He hit me again!

932
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,240
Right here, he hit...

933
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,280
Poe! Let him alone!

934
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,240
That's a fine way to treat me.

935
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,120
After I give you the best years of my life.

936
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,760
You act like that... Listen here.

937
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,560
No, no. No kisses.

938
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,360
He might have killed somebody!

939
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,680
What do you mean, might have?

940
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,720
That's alright, lady. I got him.

941
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,000
You can keep him!

942
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,880
Okay. Scram, but take this
character with you.

943
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,720
I was only kidding.

944
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,240
Just for that, he gets no c-a-n-d-y.

945
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,640
Oh, well, that's just c-a-n-d-y.

946
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,640
Sorry if I caused you any trouble, folks.

947
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,760
Yeah, and just for that, I won't
read you the funny papers tonight.

948
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,560
Put you in bed without any supper, you bad boy.

949
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,760
You wait'll I get you home!

950
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,760
You have heard the last of this!

951
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,000
Come on!

952
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,720
Look at that.

953
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,560
Why, it's somebody's coat!

954
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,160
Alright, come on outta there, buddy.

955
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,800
So that's how I got clunked on the head.

956
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,560
Come on, come on outta there, you!

957
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,080
Look! It's opening!

958
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,160
Come on, come on...

959
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,200
Oh, so it's you!

960
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,720
- Do you know him?
- Do I know him? He's the guy I caught
using the telephone!

961
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,520
- There's no law against that.
- Nevermind law, buddy. Get 'em up.

962
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,680
Now, just a minute. Don't you think you're
a little premature?

963
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,200
Prema... Well, I can't remember that far back.

964
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,720
Just who are you?

965
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,480
I'm Detective Kletty.

966
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,760
An investigator for the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

967
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,360
And I'm on the trail of the Gorilla, just as you are.

968
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,240
- A detective?
- How do we know that?

969
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,000
Yes, we...

970
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,480
Yeah, well, what were you doing in there?

971
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,800
Investigating. I've been on this case for some weeks now.

972
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,600
And I've discovered a little about
the construction of this house...

973
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,040
...that my good friend here don't seem
to have found out yet.

974
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,000
What do you mean?

975
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,480
This house is a maze of secret panels.

976
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,640
Now, undoubtedly, the voice of the Gorilla came
through that radio from someplace right in this house.

977
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,000
That means that if we find the wire leading away
from the radio...

978
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,720
We'd at least find the Gorilla's hideout!

979
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,520
And what's going on here!

980
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,360
Well, here it is. Here's the wire going right in here.

981
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,120
It's found.

982
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,160
Now, let's see...

983
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,120
Just as I thought!

984
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,560
Here's the wire!

985
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,760
Now, by tracing this, I think we may find
the answer to this entire riddle.

986
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,760
The wire goes in here.

987
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,800
Back of this wall is the man we want.

988
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,440
Now, make a note o' that, Garr...

989
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,960
- Are you all armed?
- Yes, I'm armed.

990
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,360
Quiet, you!

991
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,560
Here it is.

992
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,600
There's your microphone, and as I expected,
there's your Gorilla.

993
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,760
Mr. Stevens, the Gorilla?

994
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,880
Why, sure, I could have told you that all the time!

995
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,240
I guess the party's over, my Gorilla friend.

996
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,800
Yeah, but who tied 'em up like that?

997
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,680
I don't know. He figured the game was
up and that this would throw off suspicion.

998
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,800
This is a homemade job. A child could've done it.

999
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,600
Ah, proposterous! Don't believe him!

1000
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,960
I never saw this man before in my life! He's insane!

1001
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,880
Now, what's that?

1002
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,440
Why is it, with all the men in the house, they have to
leave us here with you?

1003
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,320
Quiet!

1004
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,720
Why, it's Mr. Stevens!

1005
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,800
- Alias, the Gorilla.
- The Gorilla?

1006
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,720
Him?

1007
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,800
Oh, I'll never trust another man if I live to be a thousand!

1008
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,320
You can make that two thousand.

1009
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,360
Uncle Walter, the Gorilla?

1010
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,440
I don't believe it!

1011
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,080
I think I can make it very clear.

1012
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,640
- Oh, sure we can!
- Now, first of all...

1013
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,720
- What's that?
- I didn't hear a thing!

1014
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,120
Neither did I, but what was it?

1015
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,080
We'll soon find out.

1016
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,560
Hey, what is this?

1017
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,720
Who hit me?

1018
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,160
What's going on around here?

1019
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,280
- It's that man again.
- Oh, there you are!

1020
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,680
Kidnapped! Kidnapped by the Gorilla!

1021
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,880
- Not kidnapped by the Gorilla, Mister...
- Conway. A.P. Conway.

1022
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,200
Ah, the A.P. stands for ape!

1023
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,480
Mr. Conway, this gentleman is the Gorilla!

1024
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,480
- The Gorilla?
- But if Uncle Walter's the Gorilla...

1025
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,760
...I don't understand why he should send
himself those notes of warning.

1026
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,440
For two reasons!

1027
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,120
To keep you here and to throw off
suspicion from himself.

1028
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,600
Ms. Denby, under the terms of your father's will,
if anything were to happen to you...

1029
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,240
...who would inherit your estate?

1030
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,600
Uncle Walter.

1031
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,800
My hunch was right.

1032
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,080
Your uncle brought you here tonight
to kill you for your money.

1033
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,960
Well, at least he had a reason!

1034
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,120
So that's why he wouldn't let us call the police.

1035
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,360
That's exactly why.

1036
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,320
But what about these men, these private detectives?

1037
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,560
They almost speak for themselves.

1038
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,800
Do you think if Stevens life had actually
been threatened...

1039
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,120
...he would've called in three morons such
as these for protection?

1040
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,240
- Protection...
- Morons!

1041
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,000
Hey! Wait a minute, I resent that!

1042
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:46,200
But I tell you, I saw the Gorilla! Right there in that closet!
I saw his hand, then his arm...

1043
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,880
And it was no optical confusion!

1044
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,200
What you saw was this sleeve!

1045
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,640
Another ingenious little invention of Mr. Stevens.

1046
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,360
A very cute little idea!

1047
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,760
Well, that about clears the whole matter up.

1048
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,800
And since it's stopped raining, I think I better go.

1049
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,200
- You're okay, buddy!
- You're okay!

1050
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,960
Congratulations! Let me congratulate you! You were wonderful!

1051
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,280
Oh, no you don't, buddy! Okay, folks.
Say howdy to the Gorilla!

1052
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,040
- Howdy.
- Alright, give out or this moron is gonna blow
your brains out.

1053
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,840
Well, you see...

1054
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,000
Now, all of you stick your hands up.

1055
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,720
I'm the Gorilla, alright.

1056
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,480
But the cops haven't been able to get me, so don't
you halfwits get any crazy notions.

1057
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,120
And as for Mr. Stevens, he's just as
crooked as I told you he was.

1058
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,760
The trouble with him is he talks too much and too loud.

1059
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,120
I got tipped off on what was gonna
happen here tonight.

1060
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,120
How he was gonna pretend to be me!

1061
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,720
How he was gonna get the two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars and at the same time...

1062
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,720
...let him get the blame for all the Gorilla murders.

1063
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,320
We were careful.

1064
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,965
I'm a little nervous tonight.

1065
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,400
Drop that gun. And I advise you not to move.

1066
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,520
Hello? Police station, quickly.

1067
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,560
What is this? I thought the phone was out of order!

1068
01:04:03,595 --> 01:04:05,080
- Maybe he paid his bill.
- Hello?

1069
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,680
This is Walter Stevens speaking.

1070
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,680
Send a squad car to my house.

1071
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,040
We've got the Gorilla.

1072
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,920
Things are so mixed-up around here that
even the Gorilla doesn't know who the Gorilla is!

1073
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,800
He's the Gorilla, he's the Gorilla.
Do I know what I'm doing?

1074
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,360
Look, what's going on here?

1075
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,960
Don't look so sad, darling. Your uncle isn't a crook!
The estate's all safe and sound now.

1076
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,200
You know, you never can tell. This is liable
to wind up to be a mystery!

1077
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,120
You see, the Gorilla murders were threatening
to bankrupt our insurance company.

1078
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,240
Most of the victims were clients of ours.

1079
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,320
So Conway, our special investigator, cooked up
his little scheme to trap the killer.

1080
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,440
I'm sorry I had to frighten you, dear.

1081
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,880
- And you, too, Kitty.
- Oh, I wasn't frightened. I was numb.

1082
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,800
You fellows are certainly great detectives.

1083
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,800
- Oh, yes.
- We could have told you that!

1084
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,240
Did you know that Kletty was the Gorilla all along?

1085
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,080
- Sure we did!
- No, we didn't.

1086
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,640
When did you find out he was the Gorilla?

1087
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,920
When I shook hands with him.

1088
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,200
- I don't get you.
- Well, you see, I was a window trimmer.

1089
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,560
In a department store.

1090

1091
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,640

are getting married soon.

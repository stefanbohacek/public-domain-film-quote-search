1
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,479
Tanaka.
Ho!

2
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,479
Fugimoto.
Yo!

3
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,980
Iuanaga.
Here.

4
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,995
Mosashi.
Here.

5
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,489
Okamoto.
Here.

6
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,130
Kanakas.
The ones from Hawaii.

7
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,589
You know what they call
us mainlanders?

8
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,639
Kotonks.

9
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,639
The way they tell it,
if you rap on our heads,

10
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,139
it's like
hitting a coconut.

11
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,639
Hollow heads,
you know.

12
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,140
Kotonk, kotonk, kotonk.

13
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,150
Look where you're
going, will ya?

14
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,489
Ninety-day wonder.

15
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,940
Still got the original shine
on those bars.

16
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,429
Lieutenant Grayson
to see the adjutant.

17
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,929
He's not in, sir.

18
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,430
The colonel said
he'd see you himself.

19
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,940
Thank you.

20
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,399
You can go
right in, sir.

21
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,950
Thank you.

22
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,239
Lieutenant Grayson
reports for duty, sir.

23
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,739
At ease, lieutenant.
Welcome to Camp Shelby.

24
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,239
Thank you, sir.

25
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
This your first assignment since
receiving your commission?

26
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,249
Yes, sir.

27
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,255
Well, lieutenant,
it's a rough one.

28
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,249
The platoon you're taking over
is just ready to start training,

29
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,749
and, as you may have noticed,

30
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,750
our facilities are not
all that they might be.

31
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,765
We're short of officers,
short of equipment,

32
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,759
short of everything
except trainees,

33
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,759
and they're coming in
by the carload.

34
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,759
This is a brand-new outfit.
A new kind of outfit.

35
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,260
No precedent for it
except one battalion

36
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,775
that was activated in Hawaii

37
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,569
and they haven't been
tested yet.

38
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,150
What do you think
of the idea, lieutenant?

39
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,159
Well, sir, I'd like
to make a request.

40
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,659
What is it?

41
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,990
I'd like your permission, sir,
to put in for a transfer

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,079
to the 36th Division.

43
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,079
You see, sir,
I'm from Texas--

44
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,999
What has that
got to do with it?

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,999
Nothing, sir,
except that the 36th

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
is an old Texas
National Guard outfit,

47
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,509
and I've been in it
ever since I got in the Army.

48
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,520
That is,
until they sent me to OCS.

49
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:01,509
I never would have gone
if I'd thought--

50
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,460
Sir, I just took it for granted
that I'd go back to the 36th.

51
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,555
You're sure that's
the only reason you have

52
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,049
for wanting a transfer?

53
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,549
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,550
No objection to working
with the kind of troops

55
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,719
we have here?

56
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,309
Because they're Japs?

57
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,970
Oh, no, sir.
Nothing like that at all.

58
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,985
Now, let's get a couple
of things straight, lieutenant.

59
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,979
First, there's not
gonna be any transfer.

60
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,980
You're staying here.
Have you got that?

61
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,489
Yes, sir.

62
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,995
Second, they're not Japs.
They're Japanese Americans.

63
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:31,320
Nisei or, as they call
themselves, buddhaheads.

64
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,409
All kinds of buddhaheads,
lieutenant.

65
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,410
From Hawaii, Alaska, California,
New York, Colorado.

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,919
Yes, and even some
from Texas.

67
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,475
They're all American citizens,
and they're all volunteers.

68
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,419
Remember that.

69
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,969
And another thing.

70
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,470
We officers are referred to
as haoles not white men.

71
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,059
Any questions?

72
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,559
No, sir.

73
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,590
Report to your
company commander.

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,160
The sergeant major will
show you to his orderly room.

75
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:58,180
That'll be all, lieutenant.

76
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,619
Sorry to keep you waiting,
lieutenant.

77
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,620
Oh, Captain Solari.

78
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,129
That's right.

79
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,135
That's our regimental slogan.

80
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:25,129
"Go for broke"?

81
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,629
It's Pidgin English
for shoot the works.

82
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,629
Pull up a chair, lieutenant.

83
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,629
Thanks.

84
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,130
I'll be with you
in a minute.

85
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,139
Tell me, sir,
do you use live ammunition

86
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,139
in the rifle range?

87
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,809
A Jap's a Jap, eh?

88
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,899
All I know is they were
put under armed guard

89
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,399
in relocation centers last year.

90
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,899
Maybe the Army just had
some surplus barbed wire

91
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,300
they wanted to use up,
was that it?

92
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,320
The Army was facing an emergency
at the start of the war.

93
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,329
A possible invasion
by Japanese troops.

94
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,829
So all Japanese Americans

95
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,829
were evacuated
from the West Coast.

96
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,880
There was no loyalty check,
no screening, nothing.

97
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,475
If there were
any spies among them,

98
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:07,969
I can assure you they're
not in the 442.

99
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,050
Every man in this outfit
has been investigated,

100
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,570
reinvestigated
and re-reinvestigated.

101
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,059
Now, I suggest you start
getting acquainted.

102
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,560
Your platoon sergeant's
over in the supply room.

103
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,569
Ohhara.

104
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,069
O'Hara!

105
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,570
That's right. Takashi Ohhara.

106
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,880
Hey, wait a minute.

107
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,370
Come back here.

108
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,470
How long you been
in the Army, soldier?

109
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:46,959
Let me see now.

110
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,459
Maybe I-- I been inside, uh,
two, three months.

111
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,679
How long you been
inside, lieutenant?

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,760
Don't you know you're
supposed to hold your salute

113
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,439
till an officer returns it?

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,019
Oh, sure. Sometime forget.

115
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,020
"Sometime forget"
to say sir, too, don't ya?

116
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,529
Sometime.

117
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,540
Well, don't forget it anymore.

118
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,530
No, sir.

119
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,529
That's your own uniform?

120
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,530
Sir, that's the smallest size
he got, the supply sergeant.

121
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,539
Sir.

122
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,050
Well, roll those sleeves down.

123
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,410
I hold salute, sir.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,010
Why are you wearing leggings
with a class A uniform?

125
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,999
To keep my pants up, sir.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,499
Long like that.

127
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,999
Well, get 'em cut down.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, yes, sir.

129
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,509
Payday I'll go see
the tailor, sir.

130
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,020
You'd better see somebody today
before I see you again.

131
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,179
All right, men.

132
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,680
All I wanna see
is backbones and elbows.

133
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,279
Come on.

134
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,779
And he made it.
Little Phoebe.

135
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,780
Pretty little Phoebe.

136
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,279
Watch that stuff,
huh?

137
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,780
Get your money
down, suckers.

138
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,289
It all rides.
Go for broke.

139
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,295
Gee, break 'em up.
Break 'em up.

140
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,789
New lieutenant outside.

141
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,870
Must be the one for us.

142
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,379
Oh, boy.

143
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,379
Eight feet tall
and mean like anything.

144
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,379
Number-one manini kind.
Chicken.

145
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Well, the honeymoon's over.

146
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,889
Mix me up. All Nisei outfit.

147
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,889
How come haole officers?

148
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,189
That's just to make us
a little more miserable.

149
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,770
First, they pick out
the crummiest camp

150
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,279
in the United States.

151
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,785
Why'd you ever enlist?
That's what I wanna know.

152
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,779
Why? Because a wise guy
college man like you

153
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
snowed me under
with a lot of fancy talk.

154
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,739
You guys
from relocation centers.

155
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,300
Okay, you probably
got it better here.

156
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:43,289
But me, I was
on the outside. Iowa.

157
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,290
A free man. Knocking off
500 bucks a month.

158
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,299
Five hundred buck?
No.

159
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,799
Five hundred buck,
yeah.

160
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,299
Chick sexing.

161
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,749
I can look
at a day-old chick

162
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,300
and tell you if
it's a he or a she.

163
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,429
Ha, ha. Now, who'd want to know
that except another chick?

164
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,015
You pay for the poultry feed
and you'd wanna know.

165
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:03,009
A he ain't no good at all
when it grows up.

166
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,649
Only the shes.

167
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,730
How come chicken farmers
no can find out themselves?

168
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,739
Too bashful?

169
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,739
You funny man.

170
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,739
Chick sexing is a science.

171
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,739
It was developed in Japan,
and it's one field

172
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,739
where buddhahead gets a break.

173
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,029
Mean to say
ya never heard of it?

174
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,529
I just got as far
as the birds and the bees.

175
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,169
These college guys are sharp,
you know that?

176
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,750
Four years at USC
and he's a bona fide,

177
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,259
recognized fruit peddler.

178
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,259
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,509
A fruit peddler with
an architect's degree.

180
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,179
I could have got a job as
an architect if I kept trying.

181
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,260
Well, why didn't you?

182
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,275
It's just my eyes.

183
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:43,430
Couldn't handle
all that close work.

184
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,025
Yeah, eye trouble,
that's what it was.

185
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:47,520
All you need
is corrective glasses

186
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,529
to take the slant
out of your eyes.

187
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,199
Hey, kotonk.
Take it easy, huh?

188
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Huh, Chick?

189
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,569
Come on, get it down.
Buck and a half.

190
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,149
One more, one more.

191
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,150
Boy, oh, boy.

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,159
You one lucky kotonk.

193
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,659
Wish I got
packages like that.

194
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
You and me both.

195
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,659
You send package?

196
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,160
Yeah. Hand me those cans,
will you?

197
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,669
Where you gonna send?

198
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,180
Brother in the Army
in Pacific?

199
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,169
Uh-uh.

200
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,169
Family in a relocation
camp in Arizona.

201
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,670
Arizona, U.S.A.

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,179
You think that chow
here is bad... Brother.

203
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,679
You can even get soap?
Oh, sure.

204
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,929
They've got a canteen
loaded with stuff.

205
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,010
Anything you want,

206
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,525
if you can get there
before they're sold out.

207
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:34,019
Yes, sir,
all the comforts of home.

208
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,019
And only one block
from the barracks

209
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,019
to the toilets and showers.

210
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,910
Barracks?

211
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,785
Everybody
all thrown together?

212
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:42,779
Got partitions.

213
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,779
Separate room
for each family.

214
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,779
My folks are lucky.

215
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,249
Only five of them
since I left.

216
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,330
Treat you like that,

217
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,925
hard to figure why a guy
volunteer for the Army.

218
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:54,509
We have to do something,

219
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,509
so we never get
a deal like that again.

220
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,090
We show 'em.

221
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,060
We show 'em us buddhaheads
good soldiers, good Americans.

222
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,599
That's the idea.
I hope it works.

223
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,349
Sure it works.

224
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,769
Already a lot of stuff
in newspapers about the 442.

225
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,360
Yeah, all we need now
is casualty lists.

226
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,360
Gee, that's a pretty girl.

227
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,369
What her name?

228
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,949
Terry.
Terry.

229
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,980
Nice name.

230
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,039
Your wife?

231
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,539
Not yet.

232
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,039
Why you wait?

233
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,039
This is a great time to be
starting a family, isn't it?

234
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,040
You kotonks, funny guys.

235
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,049
Boy, if I had a girl like that,

236
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,049
they gotta draft me.
No volunteer.

237
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,049
No, sir, draft me
and drag me away.

238
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,050
Once more, once more.
Go for broke!

239
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,150
Once more, that's all I ask.

240
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,220
That's all!

241
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,729
Seven!
Let me see those dice.

242
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,230
Attention!

243
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
At ease.

244
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,220
Men, this is Lieutenant
Grayson, our platoon leader.

245
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,709
Pick up that money.

246
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,209
Pick it up.

247
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,209
Yes, sir.

248
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,709
Donation for the company fund,
sergeant.

249
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,210
Give it to Sergeant Ohhara.

250
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,719
Can he do that?

251
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,719
It's my money.

252
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,219
I want that man's name,
sergeant.

253
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,219
There's no talking
after the command at ease.

254
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,939
Yes, sir.
This man, no dog tags,

255
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,440
needs haircut, window unwashed,
uniforms hanging wrong way.

256
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,955
Haircut, shave,
bunk out of line, dog tags,

257
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,779
window, beer can on shelf,

258
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,860
dirty floor, dirty boots,

259
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,319
haircut, window,

260
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,400
bowl of milk on floor.

261
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,909
Bowl stolen from mess hall.

262
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,409
Brought cat into barracks.

263
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,415
Floor, boots, dog tag, haircut.

264
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,409
Dust on rafters, window,
haircut, dog tags, boots,

265
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,910
bunk out of line,
litter on floor, boots.

266
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,430
Forget the book, sergeant.

267
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:03,419
They're all on the list.

268
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,419
You men will fall out
for a speed hike

269
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,419
at 8:00 tonight.

270
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,920
Before that
I want this hutment GI'd.

271
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,429
Get them started
on it right away, sergeant.

272
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,429
Floors scrubbed, rafters dusted,
windows washed,

273
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,899
boots shined, bunks made.

274
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,430
I want those blankets
stretched so tight

275
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,439
that when you drop a quarter
on them it'll bounce.

276
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,950
I'll be back twice a day
from now on

277
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,440
with a pair of white gloves
and a quarter.

278
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,449
You're a chicken expert.

279
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,950
What do you make of him?

280
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,610
Bakatare!

281
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Bakatare!

282
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
What did he say?

283
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,629
I didn't hear anything, sir.

284
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,635
Bakatare.
What does that mean?

285
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:21,130
Sorry, sir.
I don't speak Japanese.

286
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,580
Boots, dog tag, window,

287
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,090
dust on rafters, floor, boots.

288
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,400
Boots, floor, boots.

289
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,829
Blankets not tight enough.

290
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,420
Shirt unbuttoned,
boots, window, floor.

291
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,009
All right.

292
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,509
Up and over.

293
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,010
Go back and try it again.

294
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,530
I'm gonna wait right here
till everybody makes it.

295
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,310
Hey, you guys, beat it, quick.

296
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,479
In combat, anything goes.

297
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,980
That's why we teach you
dirty tactics.

298
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,075
I will now demonstrate
a grip against which

299
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:09,570
there is absolutely no defense.

300
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,590
The sergeant will now
try to get free.

301
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,109
Well, sergeant?

302
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,199
You want me to try, sir?

303
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,199
Of course I want you to try.

304
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,080
Very well, sir.

305
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,390
Eyes right!

306
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,390
Eyes front!

307
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
Eyes right!

308
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Eyes front!

309
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,410
Eyes right!

310
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,130
Eyes front!

311
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,340
Eyes right!

312
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,430
Eyes front!

313
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,370
Eyes right!

314
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,860
That was the kiss of death,
brother,

315
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,369
the kiss of death.

316
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,880
Yeah, the big brass figures
were ripe.

317
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:48,869
I can smell
that salt air already.

318
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,870
Take another sniff, will ya,
and see if it's the Pacific.

319
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,879
Yeah, that's what I'm
sweating out.

320
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,390
You and me both.

321
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,379
Nobody wanna go Pacific but me.

322
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Well, I keep trying.

323
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,889
Every time they ask
for volunteers--

324
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,395
Tommy, you have to speak
perfect Japanese.

325
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,389
It's for combat intelligence,
interpreters.

326
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,889
They don't want buddhahead
riflemen in the Pacific.

327
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,390
Why?

328
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,910
Look, Tommy,
a million guys fighting an enemy

329
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:16,399
that looks like us.

330
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,399
What if a GI sniper
spots you or me?

331
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,399
He see uniform.

332
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Yeah, and probably figure
we're spies.

333
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,909
Sam, I tell you something.

334
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,410
I don't like talk about it,
but I'm gonna tell you.

335
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,410
Pearl Harbor day
the planes they come.

336
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,419
You can only read it.

337
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,419
I can see it.

338
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,919
Pretty soon, I go volunteer
for the 100th Battalion.

339
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,919
Too young.

340
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,929
By the 442 come up,
I volunteer again.

341
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,429
Too small.

342
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,929
Next time, I stand on my toes
a little bit.

343
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,430
Okay, I'm in.

344
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,939
They send us Europe.

345
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,439
Sure, I go and fight.

346
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,439
More better do I fight
the ones who bomb the islands.

347
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,939
It's the same enemy, Tommy.

348
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
Maybe for you.

349
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,960
Pearl Harbor day, two people
visit friends near Honolulu.

350
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,950
They both been killed.

351
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,959
My mother, Sam. My father.

352
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,920
Mail call.

353
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,709
Guchizaki.
Here.

354
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,710
Hey, this is from my brother
in the 100th Battalion.

355
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,220
Nawaguchi.

356
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,719
Mail call, Tommy.

357
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,219
You go.

358
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
No mail for Tommy.

359
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Come on, close it up,
close it up.

360
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,910
Here's the list,
lieutenant.

361
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:14,399
Thanks, captain.

362
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,399
Nagashook-- Shooki.

363
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,430
William J.

364
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,019
Nishigoka.
Leonard S.

365
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,020
Uchigakiuchi.

366
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,029
Uchigakiuchi.

367
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,529
Harry.
Ikagani.

368
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,540
Joseph T.

369
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,529
Kamakura.
Sam W.

370
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,529
Toyotomi.

371
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,699
Toyotomi.

372
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,780
Tomatsu.

373
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,289
Guchizaki.

374
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,369
Satoshi.

375
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,950
Shimabukarotenshugi.

376
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,959
Shima--

377
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,959
Shimabukarotenshugi.

378
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,459
Shima--
George W.

379
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,959
Thanks.

380
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,430
Fugimoto.
Thomas H.

381
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,125
Any scuttlebutt on where
this scow is taking us?

382
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,900
I was just gonna ask you,
lieutenant.

383
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,515
Hey, Sam, how you know so sure
we're going to England?

384
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,090
Because that's where
the line forms

385
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,110
for the invasion
of France.

386
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,599
And it's coming off
any day now.

387
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,099
That's us. Shock troops.

388
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,599
Just in time.

389
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
They used up
the 100th Battalion at Cassino.

390
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,109
But anyway,
it won't be the Pacific.

391
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,109
How do you know?

392
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,109
You ever hear
of the Panama Canal?

393
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,609
Hey, Sam, what you think?
Maybe so, huh?

394
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,109
Well, if it's the Pacific,
we've been sailing three days

395
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,109
in the wrong direction.

396
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,610
The navigator don't know.

397
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,119
Nobody knows.

398
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,210
Drives you nuts.

399
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh, I'll get it.
Thank you, lieutenant.

400
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,280
For 20 years the Italian
people have been fed on bunk.

401
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,800
Their propagandists declared
that all of our people

402
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,739
look upon Italians
with contempt,

403
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,789
regarding them as a race

404
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,790
of hand organ men
and banana peddlers.

405
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,249
We know that such statements
are lies.

406
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,805
Racial prejudice is abhorrent

407
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:44,799
to our American concept
of democracy.

408
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,010
Naples with its old world
history, majestic Vesuvius,

409
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,069
the Castle of St. Elmo,
the famous churches,

410
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,569
the magnificent harbor,

411
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,600
second to none
in all the world.

412
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,200
These and many other
historic sights are of interest

413
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:11,320
to the soldier.

414
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,420
Take advantage
of this opportunity.

415
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:15,910
See as much as you can.

416
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,419
You've got a great chance
to do now,

417
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,919
major expenses paid,

418
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,919
what would cost you
a lot of your own money

419
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,419
after the war.

420
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,919
You'll want to poke around
in quaint,

421
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
out-of-the way places

422
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,929
and the only way to do that
is to walk.

423
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,049
Be sure to allow plenty
of time in Naples

424
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,635
so you can take it all in
at a nice leisurely pace.

425
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:36,130
Start your promenade
at the harbor.

426
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,650
The Italian practice
is to have a siesta hour

427
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:44,139
sometime between 1 and 4:00
in the afternoon.

428
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,140
If this custom remains in vogue
during occupational period,

429
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,655
you'll save time and patience

430
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,650
by confining your shopping
to other hours.

431
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,219
Mama, Mama.

432
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,729
Come on, come on.
Don't hog it all.

433
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,229
Let's go.

434
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,730
Off your seat
and on your feet.

435
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,659
Continuing our
tour of picturesque Italy,

436
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,660
we come to the Via Casilina,
which leads directly to Rome.

437
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,669
The districts around Rome

438
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,169
are full of places
of historical interest,

439
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,170
and transportation
is excellent.

440
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,679
Take a break.

441
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Take 10.

442
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,530
Everybody rides
but the buddhaheads.

443
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,450
That's the 100th Battalion.

444
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,129
Masami.

445
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,209
Hey, Masami.

446
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,079
Hi, you paisan.

447
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,160
My brother. Him okay?

448
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,589
Not even a scratch.
He's a few trucks back.

449
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,925
Hey, haven't got
an extra top string, have you?

450
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,719
I don't think so.
Where you going?

451
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,309
Same place as you, paisan.

452
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,309
Haven't you heard?

453
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,809
We been attached
to the 442.

454
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,229
One big, happy family.

455
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,309
No kidding.

456
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,810
Ride on, boy. Here.
Top string.

457
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,099
Bakatare!

458
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,569
What was that?

459
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,100
I said very sorry.

460
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,610
Sorry, sir.

461
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,919
Within easy reach of Rome,

462
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,925
are the medieval towns
of Tuscany,

463
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:07,419
sleepy little villages,

464
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,919
scarcely touched
by the march of civilization.

465
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,430
Take 10.

466
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,650
Hello, Joe.

467
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,659
Oh, buon giorno, signorina.

468
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,209
...Americana...

469
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,209
No capisce.

470
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,710
Ooh. No capisce Italiana?

471
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,380
No, but I'd like to learn.

472
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,389
The door open?

473
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,970
The door. The door.

474
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,020
It's open, lieutenant.

475
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,510
Grazie, signorina.

476
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
The lady is gonna
mend this for me.

477
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,409
Call me when the word
comes down to move out.

478
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,409
Yes, sir.

479
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,619
You know, I got a hunch we're
coming into a bottle of vino.

480
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,119
Maybe.

481
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Yeah, I just got a feeling
the lieutenant's

482
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,930
gonna take care of us.

483
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,949
Grazie.

484
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,450
Break's over.

485
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,459
Let's go.

486
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,970
All right. On your feet.

487
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,400
Lieutenant Grayson.

488
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,909
I forgot to tell him
we're moving out.

489
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,920
Holy mackerel.

490
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:42,909
What'll I do?

491
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,410
Close it up.

492
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,429
Si, signorina.

493
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,430
Per--
Per favore?

494
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,439
Bravo.

495
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,859
Grazie, signorina.

496
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,940
Salute.

497
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,329
Come again, per favore.

498
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,330
Amico. Friend.

499
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,339
No, I don't know him.

500
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,839
Your friend, huh?

501
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,839
Sì, Smith.

502
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,889
John Smith.

503
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,970
Capitano, John Smith.

504
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,559
Glad to meet ya, sir.

505
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,070
John Smith.

506
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,860
John Smith.

507
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Don't tell me where you got
that good-conduct ribbon.

508
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,169
Let me guess.

509
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,675
How about some more vino, huh?

510
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,170
Darling.

511
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,349
That's my old outfit.

512
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,299
Where did you get this?

513
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,849
Who gave it to you?
John Smith.

514
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,849
John Smith, huh?

515
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,849
Is he still around here?

516
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,799
When did you see him last?

517
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,359
Oh, cosa dice.

518
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,870
I gotta find somebody
who can talk English.

519
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:40,360
I'll be right back.

520
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Joe.

521
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,870
Joe.

522
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,379
Grayson.

523
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,385
Your platoon's dug in
over there.

524
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,380
Come here a minute,
will ya?

525
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,379
I've got a message for ya
from the colonel.

526
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,880
He was up here inspecting
our positions.

527
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,089
The colonel?

528
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,169
That's right.

529
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,169
He said to tell you he was
particularly pleased

530
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,470
with the way your platoon
was deployed.

531
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,059
Thanks for covering up.

532
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,559
And now I'm supposed to say
"you're welcome"

533
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,559
and that's that
until the next time, eh?

534
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,060
There won't be
any next time.

535
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,569
Don't worry about that.

536
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,569
I'll tell ya when to leave.

537
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,350
You're such a stickler on
military courtesy for your men.

538
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,659
From now on, you and I are going
by the book, understand?

539
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,739
Yes, sir.

540
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,240
I don't mind telling you,
Grayson, if there was any chance

541
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,749
of getting a replacement
for you,

542
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,755
I'd have had you
court-martialed for this.

543
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,249
Ever since you joined
the outfit,

544
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,169
you've been the one man in this
company who's been out of step.

545
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,750
You'd better pick it up,
lieutenant, and pick it up fast,

546
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,759
or you're gonna find yourself
volunteering

547
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,220
for every dirty detail that
comes up. Is that clear?

548
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,759
Yes, sir.

549
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,790
That'll be all.

550
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,059
Did you do a good job,
lieutenant?

551
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,450
Where's Kamakura?
Sam?

552
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,959
Out looking for water,
lieutenant.

553
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,965
How do you like that?

554
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,959
Dying of thirst
in the middle of a river.

555
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,459
I wanna see him
the minute he gets back.

556
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Yes, sir.

557
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Hiya, paisan.

558
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,809
Masami.

559
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,679
Eddie.

560
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,480
Vino.
Fresh off the vine.

561
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
Salute.

562
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,189
Good, eh, paisan?

563
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,710
Free sample.
Thanks.

564
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,789
Eddie.
Eddie!

565
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,870
You stay here, Tommy.

566
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,879
Watch us. Come on.

567
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,890
Keep close to the wall.

568
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,020
Stay here.
One at a time.

569
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,180
Anybody home?

570
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,170
Keep me covered.

571
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,699
You okay, Masami?

572
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,200
Just a scratch.

573
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,510
Jerry intelligence officer.

574
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,310
They're great at disguises.

575
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,890
Hiya, paisan.

576
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,539
Shells would be
coming in a lot closer

577
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,540
if those Jerries were still
in that observation post.

578
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,590
One of them
was an officer you say?

579
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:37,049
Oh, yes, colonel, sir.

580
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,630
Well, you certainly earned that.

581
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,139
Take this over to S2, sergeant.

582
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,650
Yes, sir.

583
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,639
Too bad about that
100th Battalion man.

584
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,139
What'd they say
at the aid station

585
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,970
about the other one
who was wounded?

586
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,065
Million-dollar wound, sir.

587
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:51,559
They're sending him
back to Rome.

588
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,060
Good. Well, anytime you're
in the neighborhood, drop in.

589
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,899
Thank you, sir.
I mean that.

590
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,980
I wanna keep in close touch
with you men on the line.

591
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,695
They been treatin' you
all right?

592
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:00,769
Yes, sir.

593
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,740
You're sure now,
no complaints?

594
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,359
No, sir.

595
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,860
Well, good luck to you.

596
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,875
Sir, could I have
a word with you?

597
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:13,869
Well, of course.

598
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,869
At ease, lieutenant.

599
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,369
You remember, sir,

600
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,369
that I told you I came
from the 36th Division?

601
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,870
I remember it very well.

602
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,879
Well, sir, I just happened
to hear that the 36th

603
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,385
is somewhere in this area.

604
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,879
Was, lieutenant, they're way
up ahead of us now.

605
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,879
Oh. Oh, well,
in that case, sir--

606
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Still like to get back
in the Texas Army, eh?

607
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,389
Oh, no, sir, I was just, uh,

608
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,900
hoping I'd get a chance
to visit them.

609
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:34,389
Well, I'll do better than that.

610
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,389
If we ever meet up
with the 36th,

611
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,889
I'll try and work out
a transfer.

612
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,389
Oh, thank you
very much, sir.

613
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,890
Not at all.
It'll be a pleasure.

614
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,899
That'll be all, lieutenant.

615
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,909
It's all right, paisan.

616
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,910
Maybe he know
we scared too, huh?

617
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,910
Gives a man a nice feeling

618
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,919
knowing you can always
go to the old man

619
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,425
if you're not gettin'
a fair shake, huh, lieutenant?

620
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,419
Sir, I feel bad
about forgettin' to call you

621
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,419
when we moved out of that town
this afternoon.

622
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,920
Look, you see the way
it happened--

623
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,929
Forget it. Forget it.

624
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,429
I can't.
It was all my fault.

625
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,935
And they might have had you
up for desertion.

626
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,429
But, it'll never get out.

627
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,929
The men'll keep it quiet.

628
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,929
I'll see to that, sir.

629
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,430
Thanks, thanks.

630
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,179
Squad leaders, up front.

631
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,760
Squad leaders, up front.

632
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,280
Squad leaders, up front.

633
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:55,270
Squad leaders, up front.

634
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,269
Squad leaders, up front.

635
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,059
Squad leaders, up front.

636
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,639
Are you
from the 100th Battalion?

637
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Yeah.

638
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,149
What happens when a man
gets hit?

639
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,480
Sometimes they yell.

640
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,570
Sometimes they don't.

641
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,579
Squad leaders don't last long.

642
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,590
I mean the medics.
How do they get to you?

643
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,329
Medics! Medics!

644
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,910
Get on the other side
of the road.

645
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,919
Hit it.

646
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,919
Let's go, boy.

647
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,229
Squad leaders,
up front.

648
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,229
Squad leaders, up front.

649
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,729
Squad leaders, up front.

650
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,149
Squad leaders, up front.

651
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,730
Squad leaders, up front.

652
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,739
Squad leaders, up front.

653
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,745
Squad leaders, up front.

654
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,239
Squad leaders, up front.

655
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
What are you waiting for,
sergeant?

656
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,740
I forgot.

657
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,730
Bakatare!

658
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,079
Hey, you'd better move,
Sam.

659
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,580
Maybe he gonna shake.

660
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,779
Have a good time, Frank.

661
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,860
How can I miss? Rome...

662
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,875
The greatest architecture
in the world.

663
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:24,369
Twenty-four-hour
passes.

664
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,369
Big-hearted,
ain't they?

665
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,869
I'm gonna see a lot of things
in the next 24 hours

666
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,870
I've dreamed about
all my life.

667
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,879
The Forum, Saint Peter's,
the Pantheon...

668
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,379
Any other outfit,
I bet they get three-day passes.

669
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,879
Yeah, and not just one man
at a time, either.

670
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,380
Ah, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick, chick.

671
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,389
Relax.

672
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,389
That reminds me, Tommy,

673
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,889
I hear we having
chicken for dinner.

674
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,889
No joke?

675
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,889
Yeah, I was talking
to one of the cooks.

676
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,890
Fried chicken.
Good, boy.

677
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,899
That's what I like best.

678
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,899
Not me.

679
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,399
You know
what I like best?

680
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,449
Barbecued pork, yes, sir.

681
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,039
There's nothing
like barbecued pork.

682
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,789
Especially the way I make it.

683
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,049
Mail call.

684
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,049
Jingu.

685
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,049
Hitrai.

686
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,549
Gutsizaki.

687
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,050
Mishima.
Here! Here!

688
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,060
Kawaquichi.

689
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,030
Signore, signorina,
l'amore, l'amore.

690
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You like-a vino, Joe?

691
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,509
Ah, no,
he no for sale.

692
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,509
Tre litre.

693
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,009
Three bottles, Joe.

694
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,009
Not for nothin'.

695
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,679
Quattro, cinque,

696
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,759
sei, sette, otto, Joe.

697
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,260
Waste time.
Come on, paisan.

698
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,769
Fame.

699
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,719
Fame.
Hungry. Hungry.

700
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,300
Okay, plenty meat on her.

701
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:11,809
No eat. No eat.

702
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,809
Oh, no, no.

703
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,810
Signore, signorina.

704
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,700
Papa. Mama.
Bambino.

705
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,959
Uno, due, tre, quattro.

706
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,550
Ohh.

707
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,740
Paisan, him kind of young
for papa, no?

708
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,829
Sì, sì, sì.

709
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,829
We wait.
Tre mesi.

710
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,830
Three months.

711
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,839
Arrivederci.

712
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,419
Nine bottles, ten.

713
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,420
No!

714
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,930
No, Papa.

715
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,429
Hey, Tommy.

716
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,929
Look what I got.

717
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:51,929
Lookie.

718
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,230
Here, help yourself.

719
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,819
Paisan too.

720
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,320
He no like cookies.

721
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,819
Maybe bambinos, eh?

722
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,320
Sure, go ahead.

723
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,829
Who that from, Sam?

724
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:06,829
Your mother?

725
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,829
Terry. Hey, remember
that town we took?

726
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,830
Suvereto? It was on a news
broadcast, coast to coast,

727
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,850
and they mentioned the 442.

728
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:14,339
No kidding?
I'm tellin' you.

729
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,339
And there've been newspaper
stories, lots of 'em.

730
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,339
The 100th is getting
the Presidential Citation

731
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,840
from General Mark Clark,
Sassetta, Hill 140.

732
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,860
Hey. Let me see that.

733
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,189
How you like that?

734
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,200
They gonna let your kid brother
leave relocation camp

735
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:32,689
and work on a farm.

736
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,020
Next month he gonna pick
sugar beets in Idaho.

737
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,115
Well, what do ya know.

738
00:45:36,116 --> 00:45:38,559
He's been trying to swing
that deal for months.

739
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,149
Good boy.

740
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,649
All okay, nobody sick.

741
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,289
Oh, oh, excuse, Sam.

742
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,369
That's okay.

743
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,370
I'll read the rest to you.

744
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,385
"Honestly, Sam, you'd hardly
recognize the old homestead.

745
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:57,329
"Maybe it looks the same,
the barracks, the barbed wire,

746
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,380
"the MPs, but it isn't
the same anymore.

747
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,675
"Nothing's the same.

748
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,550
"Because everybody knows
what the 442 is doing.

749
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,050
"And what means most to me
is the change

750
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,139
in the kids in my class."

751
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,589
She teaches in camp school.

752
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,179
I know, I know. First grade.

753
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,679
"They were such sad
little people, never laughed,

754
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,099
"never made a sound.

755
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,679
"Today, I'm happy to say,

756
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,019
I have as noisy a classroom
as you'll find in America."

757
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,600
More better now,
eh, kotonk?

758
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,109
Looks that way, Kanaka.

759
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,620
Plenty better now.

760
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,609
"I miss you so very much,
my darling.

761
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,610
I can't find words to tell you
how dear you are to me. How..."

762
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,970
Arrivederci!

763
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,439
How was it?
How was Rome?

764
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

765
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,400
I gotta go to the C.P.
and pick up my pass.

766
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,450
End of the line. Everybody out.

767
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
So long, Bob, see ya later.

768
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,460
Take it easy now.

769
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,589
Just wanted to let you know
we're back, sir.

770
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,639
Oh, good.

771
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,639
You're just in time.

772
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,139
Oh, thanks.

773
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,639
Sergeant, have the driver report
to the motor pool, will ya?

774
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,140
Yes, sir.
He's got a full tank, sir.

775
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,149
All set to go
with the next batch.

776
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,149
I was all set to go too.

777
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,650
Change of orders.
We're going back on the line.

778
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,649
That's kind of rough.

779
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,650
Somebody was telling me
your folks came from Rome.

780
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,165
A little town near there.

781
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,159
Oh, well, I'll get
to see it someday.

782
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,659
Sure you will.

783
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,160
Hey, we met up with some of your
folks while you were gone.

784
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,169
Your old outfit.
The 36th!

785
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,669
They passed us
on their way back.

786
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,675
The Texas wonders
had all they could take

787
00:47:57,676 --> 00:47:59,169
so they called in the 442.

788
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,169
Where'd they go?

789
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,669
The word is
they're being moved

790
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,670
to another theatre
of operations.

791
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,179
Is that straight?

792
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,690
Looks like you're stuck with us
for the rest of the war.

793
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,180
Guy gets in to fight the Japs
and winds up fightin' with 'em.

794
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,189
It's hot one
when you come to think of it.

795
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,689
Oh, I don't know.

796
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,189
A lot of us have parents who
were born in enemy countries.

797
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,189
Italian Americans,
German Americans--

798
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,190
That's different, sir,
and you know it.

799
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Why?

800
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,199
Well, it's just--

801
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,199
The shape of their eyes?

802
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,200
Or is it the color
of their skin?

803
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,209
Tell the truth, sir,

804
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,470
wouldn't you rather be
with some other outfit?

805
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:41,830
If I knew of a better outfit,
but I don't.

806
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,079
Will that be all, sir?

807
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,080
You don't have to be
so formal.

808
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,730
It was your idea
to go by the book.

809
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:52,050
That was a long time ago.

810
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,520
I'll see ya later.

811
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,229
How was it, lieutenant?

812
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,230
Great.

813
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,409
I hope the supply sergeant
takes good care of your pig.

814
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,410
Yep. I sure hope
he feeds him good

815
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,930
so he'll be nice and fat
when we get back off the line.

816
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,920
Hey, Frank, look.
Look at that.

817
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,929
Must be
an old Roman villa.

818
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,429
Yeah, you can tell it's Roman
by those columns.

819
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,469
Rubble
from another war, huh?

820
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,559
It's hard to believe.

821
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,059
Over 2000 years old.

822
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,559
The battles that must
have been fought around here.

823
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,529
Napoleon, Charlemagne, Caesar,
Alexander the Great,

824
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,310
all the way back
to biblical times.

825
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,910
More better we fight
like biblical times.

826
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:56,400
I read in the Bible.

827
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,920
Your army pick number one man,
enemy pick number one man,

828
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:04,409
and by big fight, two men,
one killed, war over.

829
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,410
I nominate Lieutenant Grayson
for our side.

830
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,390
No. I wouldn't know
who to root for.

831
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,970
It's some kind of headquarters
all right,

832
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,059
and it looks like they're
gettin' ready to pull out.

833
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,060
Yeah, with all their maps
and records.

834
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,580
And one machine gun's
holding us back.

835
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,670
A little more to the right.

836
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,740
Thirty yards.

837
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,249
Got any more?
Be right back.

838
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,699
Thirty yards to the right.
Can you hear me?

839
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,750
Yeah, officer.

840
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,129
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

841
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,640
Hey, you over there.

842
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,630
Not you.

843
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:09,190
You take over,
Ohhara.

844
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,459
Keep firing that mortar.

845
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,370
Keep it going.

846
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,850
Where's that mortar?

847
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,990
I don't think these columns'll
be here for the next war.

848
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,390
How about that mortar?

849
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:52,879
Right away.

850
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,380
I gotta move it.

851
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,679
Hurry up with that mortar.

852
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,680
Okay. Okay.

853
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,159
They moved the gun.

854
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,490
Right. Fifty yards right.

855
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,369
Short. Short.

856
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,000
Give it another 50 yards.

857
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,260
Now over to the left,
just a little.

858
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,520
That's it! Pour it on!

859
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,589
Hold it! Hold it!
Cease-fire!

860
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,170
Let's go!

861
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,930
What kind of troops
are these? Chinese?

862
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,019
Japanese.

863
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,519
Didn't Hitler tell ya?

864
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,020
Japan surrendered and they're
fighting on our side now.

865
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,289
Well,
it beats walking.

866
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,790
Maybe walking through Italy
wasn't so bad.

867
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,799
Didn't you get
the latest latrinogram?

868
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,810
We're shipping out.

869
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:42,299
Shipping out?

870
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,799
And so we take leave
of sunny Italy

871
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,800
and sail the seven seas to--

872
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:48,809
To where?

873
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,315
My guess is the Pacific.

874
00:55:50,316 --> 00:55:52,309
You really think so,
lieutenant?

875
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,809
Yeah, but don't worry
about it.

876
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,310
I haven't guessed right once
since I've been in the Army.

877
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,359
Watch that stuff.

878
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Sorry.

879
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:18,870
Tommy.

880
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,539
Oh, hello, lieutenant.

881
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,620
I told you to go easy
on that leg.

882
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,135
Plenty okay now,
lieutenant.

883
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:29,629
Well, what did you leave
the hospital for?

884
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:33,179
I've been still, lieutenant.
Three weeks. Long time, sir.

885
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,269
Don't you realize
officially you're AWOL?

886
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:38,269
I don't know whether
to put you in for a Silver Star

887
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,050
or have you court-martialed.

888
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,139
Gotta leave hospital, sir.

889
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,640
Big rumor, 442 going Pacific.

890
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,149
Me plenty sad sack
get left behind, huh?

891
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,649
Sir, maybe we still
gonna fight Japan.

892
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,030
You think so, maybe?

893
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,619
No, Tommy.

894
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,120
It's definitely France.

895
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,629
Bad cough.
I catch him in a hospital.

896
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,135
More better now. Sea air good.

897
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,629
Well, goodbye, lieutenant.

898
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,140
Goodbye, Tommy.

899
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,589
You are about to play
a personal part

900
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:18,590
in pushing the Germans
out of France.

901
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,610
Just west of the Riviera
district in southern France

902
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:23,599
lies the port of Marseilles.

903
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,099
You will be fortunate indeed

904
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,100
if you are stationed
in this fascinating city.

905
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,620
However, the chances are
you will be located

906
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:32,109
in the provinces.

907
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:34,609
Rooms with private bath
are still de luxe

908
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:38,610
in provincial towns, and you
won't always have steam heat,

909
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,625
but there are
many compensations.

910
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:43,789
For instance, your breakfast
will be brought to your bedroom

911
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:45,790
without extra charge.

912
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,349
First class on French trains

913
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,350
ranks with our extra-fare
trains,

914
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,859
second ranks
with our parlor car

915
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,939
and third class is like
our ordinary-day coach.

916
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,440
If French coaches are less
comfortable than ours,

917
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:11,460
remember that they are also
less expensive.

918
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,449
It all evens up.

919
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,950
Who's got
the time?

920
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,959
Two-twenty, sir.

921
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,959
Thanks.

922
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,379
Who do you think that I oughta
see about it, sir?

923
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,959
S1 personnel.

924
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,959
They assign
the new replacements,

925
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,960
but they're not gonna put two
brothers in the same platoon.

926
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,919
My kid brother's got a way
with him, sir,

927
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,475
and he's just liable
to talk them into it.

928
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:34,469
Bad enough being
in the same regiment,

929
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,469
but the same platoon...

930
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,470
Yeah, I'd hate for my folks
to get two telegrams

931
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,490
from the War Department
on the same day.

932
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,649
Where are
you going?

933
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,149
Think I'll ride
with my platoon, sir.

934
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,149
You're overdoing the "sir"
business, lieutenant.

935
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,649
I keep forgetting.

936
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,150
And here I've been an officer
for two hours and 20 minutes.

937
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,530
How are you doing, Grayson?

938
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,339
Hey, Sam,
you think Terry okay?

939
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,345
Sure. It was just
a little cold.

940
00:59:07,346 --> 00:59:09,339
I feel more better
when the mail catch up.

941
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,839
Long time he no get mail.

942
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,839
I wonder how my brother's
making out.

943
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,340
Me too.

944
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,849
I guess he work
on the sugar-beet farm

945
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,849
already two, three weeks.

946
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,849
Hey, Ohhara,
we want the mail.

947
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,849
Write your congressman.

948
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:22,930
Ten-hut.

949
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,439
As you were.
Carry on, men.

950
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,439
How do you like that?

951
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,970
Do they give a commission
to one of us buddhaheads?

952
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,565
No, they give it
to the mick.

953
00:59:31,566 --> 00:59:33,029
Ohhara,
the fighting Irishman.

954
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,560
Faith, and you can
say that again.

955
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,069
Now, get along
with your blarney.

956
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,580
I've got something
to tell you.

957
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:39,069
At ease.
At ease.

958
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,069
Let's be having
a little military courtesy.

959
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,569
Yes, sir.

960
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,570
I, uh, haven't
been assigned yet,

961
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,085
but it looks like I'll be
taking over another platoon.

962
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:49,579
I probably won't be seeing
much of you guys.

963
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,500
I just wanted to say, well,
so long.

964
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,919
He gonna make
good platoon leader.

965
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,419
Yeah, while he lasts.

966
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,420
He's welcome to them bars.

967
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:08,899
Sam, look at those buildings.
Seventeenth century.

968
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,350
I'm looking
at that bakery.

969
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,409
Go ahead, Tommy.

970
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,910
I'll keep an eye on the pig.

971
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,255
Stick close to the train,
you guys.

972
01:00:24,256 --> 01:00:26,249
I'm tired of rounding up
stragglers.

973
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,750
Bakatare.

974
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,759
What'd he say?

975
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,770
Oh, that's Japanese
for-- For "thank you."

976
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:35,260
They're very polite.

977
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,539
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Pardon me!

978
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,039
Hello, baby.

979
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,539
When did you learn that song?

980
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,539
When?
That's right.

981
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,039
When did you learn it?
Learn what?

982
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,540
The-- The song. Song.

983
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,049
No, no, no.

984
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,969
When you learn song?

985
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,050
Ah, last week.

986
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,059
Soldiers.

987
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,059
Thirty-sixth Division?

988
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,559
I think so.

989
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,559
Big T.

990
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,559
Are they still here?

991
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,060
No. Parti. Yesterday.

992
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,649
Au revoir.

993
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,280
Well, well.
The ambassador from Texas.

994
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,789
Good afternoon, sir.

995
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,289
You know, lieutenant, I had you
down as a determined man,

996
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,789
but I didn't think you had
enough drag

997
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,289
to get the whole darned outfit
transferred to the 36th.

998
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,289
Transferred?

999
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,790
That's right, lieutenant.

1000
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,299
We've been attached
to the 36th Division.

1001
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,310
I guess that makes us
honorary Texans.

1002
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,299
Well, fan my brow.

1003
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,939
Keep an eye out
for cattle-rustlers, partner.

1004
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,019
Well, what do you know
about that?

1005
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,020
I thought you'd be pleased,
lieutenant.

1006
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:16,529
This is the man we've been
looking for, major.

1007
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,540
One of the new combat
commissions to replace him.

1008
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:20,529
Well, there's one
in his platoon, sir. Ohhara.

1009
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,029
Good. He can take over.

1010
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,149
Take over
my platoon, sir?

1011
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,730
We've had a request
for a liaison officer

1012
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,245
to work out of
36th headquarters.

1013
01:02:27,246 --> 01:02:28,739
Someone who can get along
with them

1014
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,239
and knows the 442 thoroughly.

1015
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,739
But, sir, I've always been
on the line.

1016
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,740
Do you think I have
the qualifications

1017
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,749
for a headquarter's job?
I think you'll make good.

1018
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,169
When a man wants anything
as badly as you've wanted this.

1019
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,719
But sir, I don't want this.

1020
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,730
Remember, I told you
I just wanted to visit them.

1021
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,330
I've got a lot of friends
in the 36th.

1022
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,509
None of them at headquarters,
I take it.

1023
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,600
I couldn't arrange to have you
sent back to your platoon.

1024
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:48,809
Colonel Pence--

1025
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:50,390
Your orders will be issued
immediately.

1026
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,819
All aboard!
Texas special!

1027
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,820
Dallas, Forth Worth, Galveston,
Houston and all points south.

1028
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:07,329
Yeah, man!

1029
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,330
Ya-hoo!

1030
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:11,829
Arrivederci.

1031
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,830
Oh, no, old boy.
So long.

1032
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,339
So long, Mademoiselle.

1033
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,350
Don't forget to write.

1034
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,025
How do you like
that Texas artillery, strangers?

1035
01:03:31,026 --> 01:03:33,519
Stranger?
Man, I'm from Texas myself.

1036
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,019
Well, pull up a chair
and have a mint julep.

1037
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,270
That's mighty neighborly,
friend,

1038
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,865
but we're heading back
towards town.

1039
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:40,860
Another posse's
gonna spell us for a bit.

1040
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,490
Tommy's sure anxious
to get back to that town

1041
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,980
where he left Paisan.
Ain't love wonderful?

1042
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:50,989
Howdy, stranger.

1043
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,900
Aloha.

1044
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,879
There's only one thing I don't
like about these buddhaheads.

1045
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,880
They don't dig 'em long enough.

1046
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,319
Hello, my friend.

1047
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,350
He's here, the little Paisan.

1048
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,160
He's here.

1049
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,490
Paisan.
Hello, Paisan.

1050
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,949
You looking good, boy.

1051
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,529
You're looking wonderful,
Paisan.

1052
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,530
Come on, Paisan.
You're beautiful, Paisan.

1053
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,209
Nice pig.
He miss you much.

1054
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,789
I miss him too.

1055
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,290
Oh, thanks for taking care
of him.

1056
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,299
Thanks a lot.

1057
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,519
Thank you.
Y-you are very kind.

1058
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,110
What's the matter?
You don't smoke?

1059
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:56,599
Yes, I smoke.

1060
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,100
I was hoping maybe something
to eat for the children.

1061
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:03,029
Chocolate, crackers, anything.

1062
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:06,040
They have so little,
so little to eat.

1063
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,949
I don't have anything to eat.

1064
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,449
Trade the cigarettes.
Two packs.

1065
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,369
You can get a couple of chickens
for that.

1066
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,449
Not here.

1067
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,950
No chickens left. Nothing.

1068
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,959
All right.

1069
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,959
I'll come back later.

1070
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,709
I hate to ask.

1071
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:22,290
It won't be much.

1072
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,799
All we get is K rations.

1073
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,810
It will be a feast
for them.

1074
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,330
I wish I could get
something better.

1075
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,589
Well, uh,
see you later.

1076
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,009
Goodbye, my friend.

1077
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,879
Thank you.

1078
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,379
Thank you very much.

1079
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,380
How wonderful for the children.

1080
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:55,889
Kanakas.

1081
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,389
The ones from Hawaii.

1082
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:58,720
Let's stop a minute, huh?

1083
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,560
I won't be long.

1084
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,119
Throw those bums out.

1085
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,380
Yeah!
Go on, get up there.

1086
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:25,869
No, they're doing fine.

1087
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:27,870
Come on.
Hula-hula, Kaz.

1088
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,920
Kaz.

1089
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,509
Hey.

1090
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,010
Whoa!

1091
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,870
Would you like some wine?
Ah, merci. Merci.

1092
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:12,255
These men, the little ones,
they are really Japanese?

1093
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:15,249
Hey, shorty, she wants to know
if you're Japanese.

1094
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,250
I guess we can
let her in on it, huh?

1095
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,925
They're our new
secret weapon.

1096
01:08:19,926 --> 01:08:21,009
Twilight fighters.

1097
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,509
Twilight fighters?

1098
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:26,009
Yeah. The Army gives them shots
to make them turn yellow, see.

1099
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,510
They send them out
in the evening,

1100
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,519
just as the sun's going down.

1101
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,989
The enemy can't see 'em
in that light. Get the idea?

1102
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:34,495
That guy's been looking
for trouble all night.

1103
01:08:34,496 --> 01:08:35,989
If he makes one more crack,
I'll--

1104
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,989
Tommy! How are you?
Lieutenant Grayson!

1105
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,489
How's the leg?
Fit like a fiddle.

1106
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,990
Hiya, fellas.
Howdy, Grayson.

1107
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,999
Who's your friend,
the one with all the stripes?

1108
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,505
They don't care who they make
platoon sergeant anymore.

1109
01:08:45,506 --> 01:08:47,499
How about having a refill?
Thanks, Frank.

1110
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,999
I wanna say hello
to my old platoon sergeant.

1111
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,499
I trained under him.
Be right back.

1112
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,500
Culley!

1113
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:53,009
Grayson!
How are you?

1114
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:55,015
Lieutenant Grayson.
Yeah, how about that?

1115
01:08:55,016 --> 01:08:57,009
How about a drink?
Great. Great.

1116
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:59,009
Come on,
there's room down here.

1117
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,510
That guy would be a buddy
of Grayson's.

1118
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,519
Five to one he don't come back
for that drink.

1119
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,030
Get it up.

1120
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,800
They tell me you really
got it made.

1121
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,315
What is this liaison racket?

1122
01:09:11,316 --> 01:09:14,309
Oh, it varies, from a soft snap
to an extra soft snap.

1123
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,479
Thank you.

1124
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,059
Tomorrow I'm moving out
with you.

1125
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,060
How do you like that?
Back with the old platoon.

1126
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:21,660
You mean, I gotta take orders
from you?

1127
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:24,539
No. I don't mess around
with you dogfaces.

1128
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,119
I'll be with
the artillery observer.

1129
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,709
You're getting your artillery
from the 442,

1130
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,789
and he's never worked
with them before.

1131
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,290
They're sending us up
without our own artillery?

1132
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,800
Just the Japs?

1133
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,005
They're a good outfit, Culley.
Plenty good.

1134
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:41,500
Practically winning the war
single-handed from what I hear.

1135
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,510
Japs.

1136
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,139
Let's get outta here,
huh?

1137
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,730
Yeah, I could use
a little fresh air.

1138
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,770
You win, Chick.

1139
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,909
Japs in a Texas division.
Man, oh, man.

1140
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:04,410
Come here a minute.

1141
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,919
Culley, they're not Japs.

1142
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,919
Huh?

1143
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,425
They're Japanese Americans.

1144
01:10:12,426 --> 01:10:14,919
Nisei, or, if you prefer,
buddhaheads.

1145
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,419
But not Japs.

1146
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,870
They don't like it
and neither do I.

1147
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,929
What are you,
a Jap-lover or something?

1148
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:21,435
I said they're not Japs.

1149
01:10:21,436 --> 01:10:22,429
I'm warning ya, Culley.

1150
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,429
You're what?

1151
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:24,929
Warning ya.

1152
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,929
Lieutenant, that gold bar
looks real sweet on you,

1153
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,430
but I do believe you're getting
a little big for your britches.

1154
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,939
I can always
take the bar off.

1155
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,450
Any time you say.

1156
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,079
"Okara."
Yo!

1157
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,080
"Misoka."
Here! Here!

1158
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,089
"Nishigoka."
Hey!

1159
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,589
No letters?

1160
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:05,600
Keep your pants on.
Come on, snap it up.

1161
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:07,589
"Kiri."
Yo-ho!

1162
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,589
"Kamakura."
Oh, here, here.

1163
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:10,589
I take it.

1164
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:12,590
Cookies.
Ho-ho!

1165
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,599
"Ikagani."
Here!

1166
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,100
One cookie.

1167
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:20,599
Hey, look.

1168
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,100
How you like that.
Two sets.

1169
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,110
I go see Masami.
Woo-hoo!

1170
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:27,609
Two sets.

1171
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:28,609
Sam, Sam.
Wiki-wiki.

1172
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,609
I'm wiki-wikiing
as fast as I can.

1173
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,610
Anything from my brother?

1174
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,619
No, all from relocation center.

1175
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,630
Sugar report from Terry.

1176
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,039
"Dear Sam, I hate to start out
a letter this way,

1177
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,540
but I think it best to get
the bad news over with first."

1178
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,049
Her cold,
she no get better, huh?

1179
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:47,549
No. Terry's okay.

1180
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,555
Your mother been get sick?
Your father?

1181
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:50,549
It's my brother.

1182
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,549
He been lose his job
on the farm?

1183
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:54,049
Yeah, him and a couple
of his buddies.

1184
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,550
A gang beat them to a pulp

1185
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,559
and said they'd lynch them
if they ever came back.

1186
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,565
Why they do that? Why?

1187
01:11:58,566 --> 01:12:00,559
Why? Because they've got
slant eyes.

1188
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,559
That's a crime in some places,
didn't you know that?

1189
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,059
How do ya like that?

1190
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,399
We're good enough
to carry rifles,

1191
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,199
but we're not good enough
to pick sugar beets.

1192
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,619
Take it easy, Sam.

1193
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,699
Sure, sure,
take it easy.

1194
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,200
Take it lying down.

1195
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,379
Go on, beat it.
Blow.

1196
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:16,470
Ain't I been telling you?
Suckers, that's what we are.

1197
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:18,459
Chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick.

1198
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,909
How would you like
a dental appointment?

1199
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:21,460
Let's go, boy.
Katonk.

1200
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,469
Break it up.

1201
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:23,969
If you're looking
for a scrap,

1202
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:24,980
you won't have long
to wait.

1203
01:12:24,981 --> 01:12:25,969
We've been alerted.

1204
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,469
Pull your tents down
and move out.

1205
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,469
Pull 'em down?
We just put 'em up.

1206
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,970
The men Lt. Grayson moved out
with have been surrounded.

1207
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:32,979
The whole battalion?

1208
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,179
What's left of 'em.

1209
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,759
Grayson's okay so far.

1210
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,760
Artillery observer got hit
and he took over.

1211
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,769
Just so the lieutenant
is safe.

1212
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:40,769
Him
and his buddy,

1213
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:43,780
his dear old
platoon sergeant.

1214
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,269
What's up with Sam?

1215
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:48,770
He just got
some bad news.

1216
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,279
He's not the only one.

1217
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,290
They're gonna send
the new replacements up on line

1218
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:55,279
as soon as they arrive,
the batch my kid brother's in.

1219
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,780
Eighteen years old.

1220
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,680
Hey, Grayson!

1221
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,629
Medic!

1222
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:14,719
Where's the medic?

1223
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,220
There he is!
Over here, Joe!

1224
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,719
I found a full one.

1225
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,220
Thanks, pal.

1226
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,320
Give me a slug of that,
will ya?

1227
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,450
Hey, Grayson!

1228
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,400
Look out!

1229
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,390
You okay, Culley?

1230
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,879
Where's that
Jap artillery?!

1231
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,379
Where is it?!

1232
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,645
Wildcat six.
This is Wildcat two.

1233
01:13:51,646 --> 01:13:53,639
Fire mission. Over.
Fire mission point.

1234
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,590
Fire mission point, Fox-Able-
Easy-Baker-Mike-Charlie,

1235
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,769
and point, King-Sugar-Charlie-
Love-Able-How.

1236
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,360
Wildcat two.
This is Wildcat six.

1237
01:14:05,361 --> 01:14:07,350
Stand by.

1238
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,200
One round smoke on way.
One round smoke on way.

1239
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:35,849
Can't get a thing
outta this one, sir.

1240
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:36,849
We got enough
from the others.

1241
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,850
Send him over
to division headquarters.

1242
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,625
Get anything?
Yes, sir.

1243
01:14:54,626 --> 01:14:56,119
Added to what we already know,

1244
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,619
I can give ya
a pretty clear picture.

1245
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,619
Good.

1246
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,619
It's all dense woods.

1247
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,620
Those roads on the map
are just forest trails,

1248
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,629
and Jerry has roadblocks
on all of 'em.

1249
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:05,140
The men are surrounded
on three sides

1250
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:08,129
by elements of the, uh,
338th Infantry Division,

1251
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,629
the 198th Fusilier Battalion

1252
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,630
and the 202nd
Mountain Battalion.

1253
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,639
To the northeast--

1254
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,145
Well, let me see it
on the map, captain.

1255
01:15:15,146 --> 01:15:17,139
Well, starting here,
the Germans are dug in

1256
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:21,140
on a continuous line
all the way around to here.

1257
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:25,099
There's a gap here...
and one here that I know of,

1258
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,599
but they're covered by machine
guns with interlocking fire.

1259
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,099
There's a steep ridge here
that dominates this sector.

1260
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,100
It's almost straight up
on both sides,

1261
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:35,115
and they have a strong force
sitting up on top.

1262
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:37,609
How far away from
here is the lost battalion?

1263
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:40,609
Well, I'd say
a thousand yards.

1264
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:43,610
They're just about here.

1265
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:46,130
We'll have troops within
striking distance tonight.

1266
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,340
All right, Ohhara,
this is your spot.

1267
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,850
Good luck.

1268
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,350
Come on, shake a leg,
will ya?

1269
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,859
This don't make sense.

1270
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,370
Sticking our necks out for guys
like that buddy of Grayson's.

1271
01:16:10,371 --> 01:16:13,359
That sergeant, that's the kind
who ganged up on your brother.

1272
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,860
We get to the lost battalion,

1273
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,490
that sergeant gonna change
his mind about us buddhaheads.

1274
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:20,530
Plenty people already we change,
eh, Sam?

1275
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,829
Keeps up like Terry
been writing letters,

1276
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,340
by and by
we gonna have it good.

1277
01:16:28,341 --> 01:16:29,829
You bet. Yes, sir.

1278
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,329
Good thing
you read me letters,

1279
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,829
or maybe I go get
like Chick.

1280
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,830
It's rough.
It's plenty rough.

1281
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,339
But we know
what's it all about.

1282
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:37,299
You bet.

1283
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,339
More better we
go for broke, yes, Sam?

1284
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,839
That's about it,
Tommy.

1285
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
"More better we
go for broke."

1286
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,110
Ohhara. Ohhara!

1287
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,119
Is it bad?

1288
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,620
Million-dollar wound.

1289
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,140
Luck of the Irish.

1290
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,519
Medics.

1291
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,020
Medics!

1292
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:32,980
Medics!

1293
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,160
Let's go.

1294
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,259
I'm glad you have someone
to lean on.

1295
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,265
I don't seem
to recognize you.

1296
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,259
Have you been back
to any of the services?

1297
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,179
No, Father.

1298
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,760
I'm not Catholic.

1299
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,269
You're not?

1300
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,769
Different kind of rosary.

1301
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,770
I'm Buddhist, Father.

1302
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,270
I'll be here
if you want me.

1303
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:02,310
We're gonna try
to make contact.

1304
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:07,239
The Piper Cub's calling
the shots for artillery.

1305
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,459
They're trying
to shoot us in some rations.

1306
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,959
That'll be
a big help.

1307
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,459
Sukiyaki and rice.

1308
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,460
I could use
another man.

1309
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,469
Well, the Piper Cub pilot

1310
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,970
says there's at least a hundred
of 'em on this ridge.

1311
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,979
And they'll be shooting
right down our throats

1312
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,490
if we try to come up
from either side.

1313
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,479
Our engineers have been cutting
through a road

1314
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,979
on top of the ridge
so we can bring up a tank.

1315
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,399
They're about here now.

1316
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,980
Once that tank
gets within range--

1317
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:39,989
When will that be?

1318
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:41,489
Hard to say, sir.

1319
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,989
It's slow going.
Minefields all over the place.

1320
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:45,939
Tell division headquarters
I'm on my way back, will you?

1321
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,005
The Jerries have been
tapping the wires, sir.

1322
01:19:53,006 --> 01:19:55,499
Some of them
speak perfect English.

1323
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:00,039
Wildcat three.
Wildcat three.

1324
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,289
Sergeant Yasugomoto
speaking.

1325
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,540
Wildcat three,
this is Wildcat four.

1326
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:09,060
Come in,
Wildcat three.

1327
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:12,549
Wildcat three.
Wildcat three.

1328
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,049
Sergeant Yasugomoto
speaking.

1329
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,050
Wildcat three.
Wildcat three.

1330
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,309
Sergeant Yasugomoto
speaking.

1331
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:21,890
Good idea, sergeant.

1332
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,899
Thank you, sir.

1333
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,905
It's just that good old
Yankee know-how.

1334
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:58,430
Watch out!

1335
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,039
If I was a Jerry
on the end of this ridge

1336
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,040
and a tank got close enough
to fire point-blank,

1337
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,549
I'd take off
like a ruptured duck.

1338
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:34,549
Yeah.

1339
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,549
Right over the side
of the ridge.

1340
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:39,050
There oughta be somebody
down there to meet 'em.

1341
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,559
That's what I was thinking.

1342
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,070
Let's go.

1343
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:50,529
Hey, sergeant.

1344
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,530
Sergeant.

1345
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,539
Where's Lieutenant Ohhara's platoon?
This is it.

1346
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,045
We're your
new replacements.

1347
01:21:56,046 --> 01:21:57,039
Ohhara's the name.

1348
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,540
Another suntanned Irishman.

1349
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,550
Come on.

1350
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,060
Ohhara.

1351
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,860
They're Japs.

1352
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,330
Hey, knock it off,
will ya?

1353
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,780
What's
the password?

1354
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,759
Dipsy doodle,
that's it.

1355
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,770
That was it,
a week ago.

1356
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:18,209
Let's have
that password.

1357
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:20,879
One. Two.

1358
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,220
Bakatare.

1359
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:25,390
Come on out.

1360
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,190
Make 'em give you
the right password.

1361
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,699
You ever hear a Jerry try
to pronounce a Japanese word?

1362
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:37,319
If that's not
a buddhahead, I'll...

1363
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,899
You'll what?

1364
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,230
Sam, Chick, Tommy.

1365
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,739
A whole battalion's lost,
and we gotta find them.

1366
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:48,459
Man, I never thought I'd be
so happy to see a bunch of Japs.

1367
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:51,040
Pardon me. Japanese.

1368
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,549
I mean, Nisei.

1369
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:54,049
No, that ain't it.

1370
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,049
What is it, Grayson?

1371
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:57,049
Buddhaheads.
Okay. Okay.

1372
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,229
Buddhaheads, huh?

1373
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,229
That's right.

1374
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:09,179
He sure is touchy
about that.

1375
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,229
One time,
he even slugged me.

1376
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:13,230
Slugged you, huh?

1377
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,250
Did you hear that,
Chick?

1378
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:20,909
Where's the rest
of your outfit, lieutenant?

1379
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,409
Back there about a mile.

1380
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:23,409
But it took us hours
to get here.

1381
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,410
On our bellies,
most of the way.

1382
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,919
When do we start?

1383
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,920
Not enough of us would make it
to do 'em any good.

1384
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,170
What do we do,
lieutenant?

1385
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,169
That's up to you, Sam.

1386
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,670
I'm strictly
a liaison officer.

1387
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,270
Skirmish line
up the hill.

1388
01:25:38,271 --> 01:25:40,340
Skirmish line
up the hill.

1389
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:41,849
Skirmish line
up the hill.

1390
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,355
Skirmish line
up the hill.

1391
01:25:43,356 --> 01:25:45,130
Skirmish line
up the hill.

1392
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,725
Skirmish
line up the hill.

1393
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:48,219
Tell me something, Sam.

1394
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,719
What does bakatare mean?

1395
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,720
Well, freely translated:

1396
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:55,229
You're a heel.

1397
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:57,030
A stupid jerk and a heel.

1398
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:01,030
That was putting it mildly.

1399
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,280
Go for broke!

1400
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,300
Go for broke!

1401
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:16,810
Grenade!

1402
01:27:22,961 --> 01:27:24,950
Go for broke!

1403
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,960
Aah!

1404
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,120
Look out, Tommy!

1405
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,919
Is that all there were?

1406
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,420
They went thataway,
partner.

1407
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:53,179
Go for broke!

1408
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,340
Yahoo!

1409
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,270
Any of you guys
want a cigarette?

1410
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,779
Bye, you buddhaheads.

1411
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,280
So long.

1412
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,289
Ride 'em, cowboy.

1413
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,300
Bye! Thanks a lot, Jack.

1414
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:57,289
See you in Berlin.

1415
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,240
Look out for that mademoiselle.

1416
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,249
Take it easy.

1417
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:01,590
So long.

1418
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:02,660
Thanks.

1419
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:06,180
Au revoir.

1420
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:08,630
Goodbye, you all.

1421
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,640
So long.

1422
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,640
I'll be seein' ya.
Aloha, partner!

1423
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,149
So long.

1424
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:18,099
Attaboy.

1425
01:29:20,186 --> 01:29:22,180
See you in Paris.

1426
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,379
Battle honors.

1427
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,960
By order
of the secretary of war,

1428
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:57,310
in the name of the president
of the United States,

1429
01:29:57,311 --> 01:30:01,269
as public evidence of
deserved honor and distinction,

1430
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:04,889
the 442nd Regimental
Combat Team

1431
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:08,479
is cited for outstanding
accomplishment in combat.

1432
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,449
The gallantry
and esprit de corps

1433
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:12,980
displayed
by their officers and men

1434
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:16,489
in bitter action
against a formidable enemy

1435
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:18,989
exemplify the finest traditions

1436
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:21,990
of the Armed Forces
of the United States.

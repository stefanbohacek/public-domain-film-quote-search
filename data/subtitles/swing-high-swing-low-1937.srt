1
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,677
IT STARTED IN THE TROPICS

2
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,467
Panama Canal. Miraflores Lock. military zone

3
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:24,975
You've got your eye out, aren't you?

4
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:27,771
Yes, I've never seen anything so exciting. Come see.

5
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,000
How can you stand there with your face all smeared with mud and not see this?

6
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,200
No way to understand.

7
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,500
See what? A bunch of machines running water.

8
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:39,300
If I have to see those locks again I'll freak.

9
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,320
Ol�.

10
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,094
Hey you, I said hello!

11
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:58,600
- Are you talking to me by any chance? - No, on purpose.

12
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,383
Sentinel soldiers cannot speak.

13
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:04,800
What are you gonna do to me, fire me? Well, I'm already out.

14
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:08,200
I've accomplished my mission. Today is my last day.

15
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,700
I have an idea. It deserves a celebration.

16
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,083
Who should celebrate is the army.

17
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:15,501
Hey, are you all as pretty as your face?

18
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:18,400
No, weight 150 kg. I don't wear shoes.

19
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,000
Perfect. What are we gonna do tonight?

20
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,201
How about meeting me on the dock in the moonlight?

21
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,843
- What if there's no moon? - Meet you at the dock.

22
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,137
Seriously, how about we have fun out there when your boat docks?

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,992
Seriously, how about you disappear so I can enjoy the scenery a little?

24
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,880
The landscape is me. I'm Skid Johnson, the one-man army.

25
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,200
Ask anyone you want.

26
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,300
It was a pleasure, Mr. Johnson. Now go away, it's bothering me.

27
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,800
I am very grateful. I never thought I would admit it.

28
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,800
Meet you at the docks in Balboa.

29
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,626
I'll be in civilian clothes and have a red carnation in my lapel so you'll recognize me.

30
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,603
I wouldn't even recognize you with a rose behind your ear.

31
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,499
It might be a good idea.

32
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:15,668
Isn't it fabulous? Looks like we're in an elevator.

33
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:17,743
The first time is like this.

34
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,135
Is that smell always like this in the tropics?

35
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,000
- Look! - Oh, I completely forgot about her.

36
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,130
Come on, shoot it, quick!

37
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:32,400
It was you hanging up on time. How was it to forget?

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,100
I must have fallen asleep. The tropics give me this numbness.

39
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,152
So, how was it?

40
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,050
A grace.

41
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,400
What have they done to her?

42
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:49,290
It's the tropics, she always looks like that.

43
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,700
Let me see.

44
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,499
- Oh, did something happen? - No, no, no...

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
No, everything is perfect! Perfect, as expected.

46
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:00,761
The two of you pass by my cabin as soon as you finish.

47
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:15,563
I suspected from day one. You were never a beautician, were you?

48
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,756
No, that's where you caught me.

49
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:19,740
How could you recommend it to me?

50
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:23,700
Hey, boss, it's my friend, she's broke and she's hitchhiking to California.

51
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,250
Did I need to hitch a ride on my clients' faces?

52
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,100
It was the only idea we had. Or did you want her to sing?

53
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:31,684
Certainly not.

54
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,370
What would you want me to sing for? Can you sing?

55
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:37,200
- Yes, but not very well. - It's the only thing she knows.

56
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:41,200
But there's a guy in California who isn't even for what she knows.

57
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:42,743
You want to marry her.

58
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,800
He's a livestock tycoon or something. It's richer than Lucifer.

59
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,400
- Lucifer wasn't rich. - What was he?

60
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,250
- He was... What was he? - Proud.

61
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:55,700
Proud, didn't I tell you? Don't try to change the subject.

62
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,638
Now, if Lucifer were so... That is, if that man were so proud...

63
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:01,700
That's it, rich man, why don't you send him a ticket?

64
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,957
He doesn't even know I'm on my way.

65
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:05,000
Didn't I say he was going to marry her?

66
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,900
No, I said I wanted to marry her.

67
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,400
Oh, sorry, sorry...

68
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:10,771
Maggie must think there's something wrong with him.

69
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:11,917
Yes of course...

70
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:15,449
That's why you want to think carefully before making any decision.

71
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,100
She doesn't know him that well.

72
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,763
He's known me for three years, but it's so hard to explain.

73
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,331
If Maggie were a singer the house would be packed.

74
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,100
- Clear. - She used to work in clubs but...

75
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,208
Every time I go to New York he talks about buying an alliance.

76
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:30,837
- He's just crazy about her. - Simply crazy, ?

77
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,200
Simply crazy...

78
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:36,435
I'm the one driving you crazy, this is.

79
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,200
You have to haggle with these people.

80
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:57,441
I start here and you start there. Everyone will ask for $3.

81
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,600
- If anyone accepts $2 call me. - Sure, 3 bucks no way.

82
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:05,000
- Taxi, $ 3 an hour. - How much?

83
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:07,301
- $3 an hour. - No, too expensive.

84
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:10,800
Ma'am, take my car. Tour of Panama City for $1.

85
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,325
- How much? - One dollar.

86
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,088
Wait a minute, I'll call my friend.

87
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,231
Thanks.

88
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:28,200
One of the most notable public buildings in Panama is the President's Palace.

89
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,300
Built centuries ago on the former place of residence of the viceroys of Spain...

90
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,000
during or colonial period.

91
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,051
On the ground floor, a Moorish courtyard, in the center of which...

92
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:41,550
there is a pond with water chickens, a native species.

93
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,151
In your land, ducks.

94
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,800
Ducks my ass! This isn't even a palace, it's a cathedral.

95
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:48,700
- Must be the wrong address. - And wrong tour guide too.

96
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,499
Listen here, smart ass, you can take that hat off.

97
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:06,700
Is there a problem with the hat? There's a rose behind her ear too.

98
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:07,967
I still don't know you.

99
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:11,142
You're a big liar, you know? She wears shoes and has a beauty of...

100
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:14,400
- Hey, do you know this guy? - No, and I'm tired of the joke. Stop the car!

101
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:18,500
Come on, fine. Didn't I tell you I left the army today?

102
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,101
The four of us are going to have fun celebrating.

103
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,700
- Who's the fourth? - Harry. It's his car.

104
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,039
We are not interested.

105
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,072
Speak for yourself.

106
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,300
I don't know why you're upset.

107
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,600
They hired me thinking I was a native.

108
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:35,983
But they ended up with a first-rate American and his friend.

109
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:40,027
This is where Harry lives. You'll like him.

110
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,981
And instead of buildings and statues, let's show you the real city.

111
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,806
They won two guys who fell from the sky and still complain?

112
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:48,800
Come on, take it easy.

113
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,200
Let's walk around. I'll tell my usual jokes.

114
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:53,601
If they laugh, it's because they're smart, if not, it's because they're dumb.

115
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,454
They have nothing to lose in two hours. What is 2 hours?

116
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:59,715
I've never seen anyone talk so much. Have you ever tried to sell anything?

117
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:01,600
Yes, right now. Me.

118
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:04,600
Wants to know? If you had something quality to sell you would be great.

119
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,899
Harry!

120
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,198
Hey Harry! Come on, let's go out.

121
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:20,067
It's fine.

122
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:25,300
Harry gives his all when he plays the piano.

123
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,700
Everything?

124
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,900
Girls, get ready.

125
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:32,700
They are about to meet Harry Rafkin, the hottest pianist in Panama.

126
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:35,299
I could. It must be boiling in that overcoat.

127
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,900
I'm recovering from a fever.

128
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:41,300
Want a quinine pill? After all, we are in the tropics.

129
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,400
Yes I know. And you, you know?

130
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:45,200
I think you should have one.

131
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:48,850
If you're my date, I already have my pill.

132
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,100
- Harry, this ... - Her.

133
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,950
- She. And this ... - Marguerite.

134
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,500
- Maggie. - Marguerite.

135
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,400
How are you? It's a pleasure to meet you.

136
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,438
Ol�.

137
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,456
In your case, anyone would be a pleasure.

138
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,709
Thanks.

139
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, let's get going. Come on ahead with me.

140
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:06,126
Better to jump. The door is stuck.

141
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:11,500
- Oh, allow me. - Thanks.

142
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:37,457
This house is typically Panamanian. Few tourists come here.

143
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,499
Um, it's beautiful. I loved it.

144
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:43,300
What do you think I should order?

145
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:44,856
Oysters.

146
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,135
Oysters.

147
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,900
Hey, better get closer. - Why?

148
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
- You know where it is, don't you? - So what?

149
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,500
- It's in the tropics. - I know that, silly.

150
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,100
- And tonight. - It's nothing.

151
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,700
Almost night.

152
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,400
- Where do you want to go? - To you.

153
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,948
So as to. That way we can't have fun.

154
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:05,026
Said.

155
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,100
Most girls like my little jokes.

156
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:10,300
- I can make myself comfortable, can't I? - If I were you I wouldn't exaggerate.

157
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,450
- You're kinda quick on the trigger, huh? Your impression.

158
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,100
You've been here a while. It got a little sluggish in the tropics.

159
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,200
What was it? Won't you eat the rest of the oysters?

160
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,335
Not this.

161
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:49,936
Do you feel it? It's like a permanent breeze enveloping you.

162
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:50,957
But .

163
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,400
It's not that, it's like it's something inside...

164
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:56,201
a certain drowsiness, like in front of a fireplace.

165
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:58,302
Oh, I understand...

166
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:01,900
The more time you spend here the more you feel it.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But this is bad. You can't spend your whole life in front of a fireplace, right?

168
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,151
Listening.

169
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:09,200
What song is this? Pretty, isn't it?

170
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,391
�...

171
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:13,192
I'll stop listening to that kind of music starting tomorrow.

172
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,499
- Are you leaving Panama? - Yeah, I'm going to New York.

173
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,000
Hope you have more luck there than me.

174
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,200
I don't need to worry. If that doesn't work, I can reenlist in the army.

175
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,301
Are you married?

176
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:33,102
No. Do I look like a marriageable girl?

177
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,803
- Have. - I am.

178
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,604
But I don't. So don't give me ideas.

179
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,550
It would be pretty ridiculous for me not to kiss you, wouldn't it?

180
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,551
It would be ridiculous if it were me.

181
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:45,700
I dunno... We'll never see each other again and...

182
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,701
what difference would it make?

183
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:50,500
- Then why kiss? - What do we have to lose?

184
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:52,300
What do we have to gain?

185
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:54,900
How you complicate things!

186
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,150
Look at these stars, they've been there for millions of years...

187
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,200
And millions of people have already kissed. What difference would one more make?

188
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,499
Is that your logic?

189
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,700
- That. - All right, it doesn't make any difference.

190
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,100
Thanks.

191
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,401
- Do you feel better? - Let's go.

192
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,102
Where we go?

193
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,203
To the Pavilion to take something.

194
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:21,704
Wait, my bag.

195
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,600
Why uncle?

196
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:31,300
Look at these stars. It's been there for millions of years.

197
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,801
All right, you won.

198
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,300
Glad they stopped.

199
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:58,600
- Don't like the trumpet? - Nobody likes the trumpet.

200
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,900
What will you drink?

201
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:02,500
- Two punches. - Very well.

202
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,700
I don't agree.

203
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:06,500
Maybe someone likes it, but no one is very smart.

204
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:09,000
You're right, I like it.

205
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,857
True? I don't understand how it can, it's just noise.

206
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,930
It's just blowing a bunch of air into a horn and it comes out ra-ta-ta-ta... It's horrible.

207
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:18,531
What is it, you don't like music?

208
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:21,900
Of course I like music. But that's not music, it's like...

209
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:26,900
Of course I like music. I love violin, it's so sweet and romantic.

210
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,499
And trumpet is not romantic.

211
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,938
Trumpet, romantic? Ah!

212
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:33,500
So you don't like the trumpet.

213
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,200
I don't like the trumpet.

214
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:44,035
It's playing for me. He rings... And did you hear the things I said?

215
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:58,384
The music is beautiful, but you are a thousand times more beautiful.

216
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,264
It's beautiful as a flower, let's not miss this splendid moment.

217
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:08,820
Let's dance to celebrate our date.

218
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:12,584
Yes, he is wonderful, really wonderful.

219
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:45,468
Let me take you in my arms and we'll dance until dawn.

220
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:48,305
- Let's go? - No.

221
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:50,218
Why not?

222
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:55,076
Have I been disrespectful to you? You took off your hat, didn't you?

223
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:57,499
- Wasn't it? - No, no. Yes... no!

224
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,497
- Some problem? - I don't know. I think you're being a bit abused.

225
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:04,200
I advise you not to interfere. I saw the se orita first.

226
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,432
, and well abused.

227
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,499
Why don't you hit him then?

228
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,854
- I can't, you took off your hat. - So what?

229
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,874
It's a Latin American custom. It means dancing with anyone.

230
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,875
She just took off her hat for me.

231
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,400
There's no reason she refuses me. You are the one refusing.

232
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:20,595
You misunderstood. Now get out of here.

233
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:21,900
Don't intrude, sir.

234
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:24,499
Otherwise I will forget that I am a gentleman.

235
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,950
The se orita comes with me.

236
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,750
I told you to go away. Come on, get out of here.

237
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,400
- Look, she's wearing a hat. - Yeah, I'm wearing a hat.

238
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:34,400
- Chap u? - Sim, chapeau, hat!

239
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,100
Ah, hat.

240
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,200
Hat!

241
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,393
Let's get out of here.

242
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,946
What's going on here?

243
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,514
Wait ... each of my hats?

244
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:22,800
I took off my hat and he was abused. I didn't know it wasn't for taking.

245
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,714
I didn't know, got it?

246
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:24,978
You're wearing a hat now, aren't you?

247
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:27,500
- Explain that to the judge. - No, no...

248
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:30,500
- Come with me. - And wait, let me go!

249
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:34,467
You can't do that, we're American citizens.

250
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,347
- Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself? - No. Give me your handkerchief.

251
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,034
- Are you going to cry? - No, I'm going to tie my hat.

252
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,092
Skid, here.

253
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:55,961
It's me, Harry.

254
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,293
Don't even speak to him.

255
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:00,776
Where were you last night when we needed you?

256
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,900
- Come on, move. - Calm down, let's go.

257
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:14,600
- But Skid, I've arrived. - Hi.

258
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,732
Skid, I wish I could help.

259
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:26,400
For some, Panama can be a symbol of pleasure.

260
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,600
To some extent, yes. But for us it has a much broader meaning.

261
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,200
Thus, it is impossible for us to tolerate scandals...

262
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,680
- Did you hear that? - Never mind.

263
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:35,700
That whistle!

264
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:40,829
Therefore, this court sentences them to a fine of 50 pesos.

265
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:43,391
Said the fine is $50.

266
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:46,472
This! Maybe it's my boat.

267
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:51,692
Listen! Guards, stop them! Where are they going?

268
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,600
- Come on, let's go! - Wait, he's a friend of mine.

269
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:57,464
Look, it's my boat. It's leaving! What do I do, Skid?

270
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,670
We have to get out of here!

271
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:01,469
Maybe I can still board.

272
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,911
- Stop there. - But we have to go!

273
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,243
Don't you understand? My boat is leaving. My boat!

274
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:08,686
- Boat? - Yes, boat.

275
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:12,980
Boat, yes. Look... uuuuuh... Boat.

276
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:15,898
What? I don't understand what you're trying to say.

277
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:18,154
- You mean boat. - Yes, boat, chooo-chooo!

278
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,499
Well, now I sentence them to a fine of 60 pesos.

279
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,800
Now they must pay 60 dollars.

280
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,300
I've been patient and tolerant, but even a judge's patience has limits.

281
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:28,500
Shut up!

282
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:31,000
This court condemns you to a 150 pesos fine.

283
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,123
Now the fine has risen to 150 dollars.

284
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:39,073
It's better to be quiet.

285
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,924
- Now can I help? - No.

286
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,929
Could you leave it for 60?

287
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:48,420
I don't think so.

288
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:52,811
Here are 100, 110,

289
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,112
112...

290
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,196
Give me the travel money.

291
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:04,850
127, 128...

292
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,510
128,50... 128,52.

293
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,555
Now?

294
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:15,339
Now you can.

295
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,000
Want to buy a ticket?

296
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,200
- I don't have money, understand? - Go away, in the "denero".

297
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,556
- And now? - First, let's find a hotel and...

298
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:31,500
What will it do? I don't have a penny, no clothes...

299
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,700
- They won't let me in. - I hadn't thought of that.

300
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,637
- What are you going to do? - I don't know.

301
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:39,300
If you allow a suggestion, I could stay at home.

302
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,300
- What? - Skid tamb m mora l .

303
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,650
And that solves everything, right?

304
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,600
- Don't worry, I wouldn't allow it. - So where am I staying?

305
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:49,954
You will be very well accommodated. Skid and I will sleep in the living room and you stay in the bedroom.

306
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,100
You will have a key to the door for any need.

307
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,503
- I didn't like the idea. - Me neither.

308
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,172
It's very welcoming.

309
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:08,791
I lost the key last month.

310
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:15,714
Here's where we live.

311
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,100
Is Skid e voc ?

312
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,300
Skid moved in last night. I've lived here alone for three months.

313
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:29,499
You mean you did it all by yourself in 3 months?

314
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,718
The bedroom is also very nice.

315
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,300
The kitchen is over there. But I think it needs a cleanup.

316
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,300
If it's in this state, for sure.

317
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,499
Some problem?

318
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:46,499
You and Skid get the bed. I'll fix this place.

319
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:49,600
- Let's sleep first. - Who can sleep in that area?

320
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:51,100
We have.

321
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,064
Oh, c�us.

322
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:04,139
Never left since I moved.

323
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:11,365
Turn it over and don't drop it. Be careful.

324
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:15,489
- Where's the water? - At the pump.

325
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:17,801
- What? - At the pump!

326
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,970
- What's it? - The bomb.

327
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:30,746
Look, the shoe I couldn't find for three weeks.

328
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:34,246
Do you think you will make it?

329
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:38,461
Let her go. Let's take out the net.

330
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,500
There's not much.

331
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,499
- The coffee will be very weak. - Stay what?

332
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:47,200
Weak, the coffee!

333
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:50,100
Oh. Let's try it like this.

334
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,608
- Try how? - I'm talking about the bed!

335
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:57,000
- Will you want it in bed? - No, with toast.

336
00:23:57,053 --> 00:24:00,200
- There's no bread here. What did you understand? - She's talking about the bread.

337
00:24:00,242 --> 00:24:04,800
Oh, option? There's no bread! I gave the rest to the pigeons.

338
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:07,300
Ah, so this is what lives here with you.

339
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:10,343
- What did she say? - What did you say?

340
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:14,424
Said it would do good if they had some goats living here too.

341
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:20,372
What would she want a goat for?

342
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:23,300
Come on him.

343
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,808
Raise the back.

344
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:31,236
- What? - Raise the rear a little.

345
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:33,515
No need to scream, I'm here.

346
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:37,914
- Where do you connect the gas? - No gas.

347
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,115
- So how am I gonna cook? - On the wood stove.

348
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,655
Listen, this isn't gonna work.

349
00:24:48,884 --> 00:24:50,800
I have an idea.

350
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:54,502
Let's sit down and think about it calmly.

351
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:57,200
There has to be some way to resolve this.

352
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:07,519
I see they always eat out. It's very bad. That's why Harry is sick.

353
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:11,596
We have a lot to buy at the grocery store.

354
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:19,499
I think I did it wrong. Guys, I think I did the wrong thing!

355
00:25:19,632 --> 00:25:21,747
Hey Skid, I think...

356
00:25:25,186 --> 00:25:29,100
And now? Well, never mind, I'll figure it out myself.

357
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,932
- Trash. - Hey, wait a second.

358
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,900
What situation did I create for you guys, huh?

359
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,880
In my case it's temporary, just until my boat comes back.

360
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:42,900
And you, what are you going to do?

361
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,318
Don't worry about me, you can always go back to the army.

362
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:48,260
- The army. - Do you expect me to become a native?

363
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,472
No! Come on, get this stuff and set it all on fire.

364
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,871
Why so many beer caps?

365
00:25:53,236 --> 00:25:55,824
I almost won the lottery.

366
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,061
The army, always the army. No ambition.

367
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,741
- Skid. - What?

368
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:19,100
- You could do something with... - With what?

369
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:21,400
It's a crime to hide a talent like yours in the army.

370
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:23,557
You are the best trumpeter I ever heard.

371
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:25,392
I thought you didn't like trumpet.

372
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,508
I didn't like it and I don't, but I like it when you play.

373
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,509
I don't know why, it's different.

374
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,547
Why don't you try to make a living from it?

375
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:33,467
- Employ me on this? - Yes.

376
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:36,700
Not wanting to mess with me, but Skid could work with Murphy.

377
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,580
How wonderful! Did she offer you a job?

378
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,981
Why not accept? Would you need your own trumpet?

379
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,750
Of course, it's impossible to play in an orchestra without your own trumpet.

380
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:45,489
But, Skid has one.

381
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:47,172
Need to advertise?

382
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,947
Why, you might even like it. Even more than the army.

383
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,499
You'll never know if you don't try.

384
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,500
You can know right away.

385
00:26:55,124 --> 00:26:56,225
Skid!

386
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:48,500
Come on, cock. Come on, finish him.

387
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:53,429
Come on, finish him! What's his name?

388
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,698
The Winged Triumph. It is worth nothing.

389
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,192
Come on, attack, finish him.

390
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:29,700
Skid, did you get it? Harry, Skid has arrived!

391
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:31,556
How much will you earn? Will it start soon?

392
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:34,781
- Well, not right away... - What happened?

393
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,047
Hey, Skid, did you ever notice you're holding a rooster?

394
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:38,691
Yes I know.

395
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:40,755
Where did you get this?

396
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:42,275
He got into a fight.

397
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,769
- What difference does it make? - He was getting beaten up.

398
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:51,052
Do you think I was going to leave him there until they finished him?

399
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,300
Oh, n�o.

400
00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:54,300
Not very well, he...

401
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:57,200
Anyone with the least amount of sensitivity would have done the same.

402
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:59,324
It's hurt. I'll get something.

403
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:03,120
Poor guy, he's hurt pretty bad. Go get a wet towel.

404
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,577
Of course, of course.

405
00:29:05,382 --> 00:29:07,763
Poor thing, what was the fight for?

406
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:09,959
Want to know his name?

407
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,583
nice. The Winged Triumph.

408
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:16,653
It means winged vitriol.

409
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,568
All right, but better call him Butch.

410
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:23,268
Hey, you're not mad at me, are you?

411
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:26,094
- Anger at what? - Because I bet on him.

412
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,067
- Bet on him? - Is that...

413
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:30,500
You are a professional cock and...

414
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:35,051
Well, it was doing fine until my legs were wobbly and...

415
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:39,239
Then he lost and I lost the money.

416
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:43,748
That money? You don't... Skid Johnson, where's your trumpet?

417
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:49,300
I committed. But I still have the mouthpiece, I can keep practicing.

418
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:52,907
You understand...

419
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,848
Cologne, this should do.

420
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,216
Why work a whole week if you could earn the same in minutes?

421
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:06,480
- Master play. - I found what he needs.

422
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:07,555
- What's that? - Colony.

423
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:09,700
Cologne? Are you going to put cologne on a rooster?

424
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:12,950
- Nothing better wounds, I wear. - Then don't say I didn't warn you.

425
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,180
It'll be good soon.

426
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:18,200
Butch, come here. Come come...

427
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:21,100
Hey, go away, get out! X !

428
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,153
I won't even remember that I saw you...

429
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:26,847
Get out there, x ! Go away!

430
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,478
Skid, get this thing out of here.

431
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,800
Come on, Triumph... this is, come on, Butch!

432
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:34,100
Come on, Butch!

433
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:37,568
I scared you, didn't I? Skid, get him.

434
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:41,472
N�o o excite, n�o o excite... Pronto, Butch.

435
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:49,300
You don't know Murphy. How am I going to ask for an advance if I haven't even been employed yet.

436
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:53,000
You won't have a job without the trumpet or the trumpet without the $5.

437
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:56,417
- I'm too young to die. - Wait here and I'll ask.

438
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:58,800
No, no woman needs to intercede for me.

439
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:02,350
Listen, sometimes it's easier to sell someone else's image than your own.

440
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,450
It's easier for you to praise me than yourself, isn't it?

441
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:09,326
- Wait a minute, I'll be back in a minute. - Even less.

442
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:13,056
But Mrs. Murphy, I'm not the one I came to ask for a job.

443
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,200
So forget it. But you can't find a better home.

444
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:19,600
You have the type I need in the house. Nor would I have so much to do.

445
00:31:19,651 --> 00:31:22,900
Sing a little, dance a little... and talk to the customers.

446
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:26,054
I think you're making a big mistake. Anyway, okay.

447
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
But it's Skid who has talent...

448
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:31,400
Skid's talent is causing more trouble than a bunch of Panamanians.

449
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:34,200
I heard what he did yesterday at Pallera.

450
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:36,241
The house will be closed for a week for works.

451
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,300
My bar is one he won't vandalize.

452
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,167
- Oh, that. - Yes, that.

453
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:42,754
Good...

454
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:48,200
I should have gone there yesterday, it was beautiful.

455
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:51,118
I bet you do. There's nothing left of the place.

456
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:55,559
Skid was very shaken by that. A young man fresh from the army...

457
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:58,750
full of responsibilities. It's very difficult.

458
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,831
Skid Johnson has never had any responsibility in his life.

459
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:04,957
He has me.

460
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:08,300
It shouldn't be that serious.

461
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:11,901
You've only known him for a while, right?

462
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:17,266
Little? Why, Skid and I have known each other since we were children.

463
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,500
He called me as soon as he left the army.

464
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:22,508
I wouldn't marry him if I stayed in the army, would you?

465
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:23,897
N�o.

466
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:27,400
Imagine how he would feel, on his honeymoon with his wife working,

467
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,200
...hard, unemployed.

468
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:31,391
�.

469
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:34,543
Also, we do a musical number together. We always work together.

470
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:38,273
Not in the army, of course. Can't you see?

471
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,500
I only understand one thing.

472
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:43,601
Looks like Skid has a lot more sense than I thought.

473
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:49,865
Thanks.

474
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,355
- Hi, do you remember me? - Hi, what a time. Which...?

475
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,913
- Wow, how did you do it? - Why, she understood me.

476
00:32:59,956 --> 00:33:02,150
It's crazy of you, Skid. She is a very nice woman.

477
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,170
A Murphy?

478
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,444
Behind all that hardness there is a woman and every woman is romantic.

479
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,860
Murphy rom�ntica?

480
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,530
As soon as he heard we were married, it all fell apart.

481
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:14,381
As soon as I knew what?

482
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:16,925
Skid, don't be mad I said we were married.

483
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,800
- Married? - What difference does it make?

484
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,950
Gave you a job and even got me a job for a few weeks.

485
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,100
By now my boat will be back and I'm leaving.

486
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:26,701
No need to be angry.

487
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:29,504
I'm not angry.

488
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:33,297
Angry?

489
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:36,998
Not even a little.

490
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:05,200
Hi Murphy, I hear there's a new blonde working here.

491
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,635
Yeah, but it's not army rations, it gets cold.

492
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,000
- Metidinha, hein? - �.

493
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:12,056
- How many are there, sir? - Five.

494
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,419
This way.

495
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:19,491
Ol�, Skid.

496
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,881
Hey, Maggie!

497
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:53,700
You were great. Made the others look like elephants.

498
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:54,720
Thanks.

499
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,700
- Where did you learn to walk like this? - Well, I...

500
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,818
Oh dear!

501
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,202
I was so happy when Murphy told him he was working here...

502
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,200
Uh, Ms. Álvarez, this is Ms. King.

503
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,300
- How is it going? - Oh, Miss. King.

504
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,910
I thought it was the new Mrs. Johnson they talk so much about.

505
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,347
- And I'm. - Don't say.

506
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,376
Sim.

507
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,181
Gee, Skid, I thought I knew you. I didn't believe it was a marriage.

508
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,500
And I still don't believe it.

509
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,736
- An old acquaintance. - Old?

510
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,500
- Yes, old woman! - Oh, whatever.

511
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:33,500
But if you want to keep your job, you better introduce me as your wife.

512
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:36,300
- We're married, remember? - Yeah, but not my wife.

513
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,000
No, but that's what it's supposed to be.

514
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:43,100
# Nowadays every dance academy # # Exercises your whole anatomy too #

515
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:45,698
Come on, it should be working.

516
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:47,930
Yeah, and lots of other things too.

517
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:53,631
# Wild fever that rages # # Watch out, it's contagious #

518
00:35:57,232 --> 00:36:01,650
# I've got Panamania # # Wild hot Panamania #

519
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,500
# Gals from Pennsylvania and Peru #

520
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:08,378
Maggie, let me help you change. A customer wants to meet you.

521
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,679
A hanger magnate from Cleveland.

522
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,940
You get 25% of all champagne they order...

523
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:16,141
Thats 10% for the whiskey.

524
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:18,502
# ...will vanish in you #

525
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:22,700
# Senses reeling, you'll be revealing # # The Spanish in you #

526
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:24,214
Murphy, who is this girl?

527
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:27,327
- Anita lvarez, why? - Cute.

528
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:30,708
# Your decision # # Panamania! #

529
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:33,809
# I've got Panamania # # Wild hot... #

530
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,100
Mr Musselwhite, may I present to you Miss Musselwhite. Johnson.

531
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:37,927
- How is it going? - Nice to meet you. MS. Johnson.

532
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:39,300
Would you like a scotch and soda?

533
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,786
In the tropics? Don't you know this is poison so close to the equator?

534
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:47,100
- Only serve champagne. - So you just drink champagne here?

535
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:49,815
She's right, Mr Musselwhite. Waiter.

536
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:57,000
# Senses reeling, you'll be revealing # # The Spanish in you #

537
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,101
# Won't need your physician #

538
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:03,300
# Your own intuition # # Tells you your condition's #

539
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:04,801
#Panamania! ,

540
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,602
# Panamania, Panamania #

541
00:37:14,745 --> 00:37:19,900
He said they would have to order 100 batches of hangers or they wouldn't get...

542
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,912
- Can you hear me? - Yeah, I'm listening.

543
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:30,400
# Senses reeling, you'll be revealing # # The Spanish in you, Spanish in you #

544
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,500
# Won't need your physician #

545
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:36,601
# Your own intuition # # Tells you your condition's #

546
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,200
# Panamania, Panamania #

547
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:40,300
# Panamania, Panamania, Panamania #

548
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:43,601
# Panamania, Ohhh! #

549
00:37:48,654 --> 00:37:51,100
Excuse me, I need to change.

550
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Of course.

551
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,024
Maggie.

552
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,500
You shouldn't wind these guys up. They can misinterpret.

553
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:04,500
What difference would it make to you?

554
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:08,100
None, none. But remember, it's for us to be married.

555
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,800
Yes, but we're not.

556
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,140
Who will ball these things for Murphy?

557
00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:37,100
Did you know you're longer on one side than the other?

558
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:39,505
Yeah, he was born on a hill.

559
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:42,600
No, I think it's from supporting a foot so much while beating the rhythm of the songs.

560
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:46,624
Come on Skid, keep playing.

561
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:49,400
Butch, the army is proud to present you...

562
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:51,500
the new star of trumpeter art.

563
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,100
Stop talking about the army!

564
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:56,451
I told you, hearing him play just makes me shiver.

565
00:38:56,791 --> 00:39:00,600
"Hearing it play just makes me shiver." Hey, that rhymes.

566
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:05,600
"The tropics turn me on, but hearing him play just makes me shiver." Not bad.

567
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,700
Not good.

568
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,600
Better than the song I wrote at school.

569
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,959
"� Luta, Redland Conservat�rio de M�sica"

570
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,800
- I bet you were successful. - And it was.

571
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:21,550
"� Luta, Redland, Conservat�rio de M�sica."

572
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:24,700
Aqui gave a pause. La, la, la, RCM.

573
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:26,500
Wait, play this slower.

574
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:34,650
No, no, with more swing. You know... Daaa.

575
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,200
- Got it, ballad type. - Hey, ballad.

576
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:40,300
Toca, Skid.

577
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,000
Hearing it play just makes me shiver.

578
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:50,000
Harry, the lyrics... The lyrics for the song.

579
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,700
I think it will work. Get a pen and paper.

580
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:53,800
Wow, it's beautiful.

581
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Do you think if she gets better she'll let us introduce her?

582
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,000
Why?

583
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,200
Didn't I tell her we're doing a number together?

584
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:03,744
- Said a lot of things, huh? - Said yes.

585
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,000
What's the first line, Harry?

586
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:10,200
"The tropics turn me on, but hearing him play just makes me shiver."

587
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:26,001
# When you blow that horn you thrill me #

588
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:31,200
# To the marrow of my bones you chill me #

589
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,000
# There it goes #

590
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:39,001
# I hear a call to arms #

591
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:41,802
# La-de-da-de-da #

592
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:46,803
# Oh the bliss each note expresses #

593
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:52,304
# Reaching out to me like soft caresses #

594
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,605
# There it goes, I hear a call to arms #

595
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:01,906
# La-de-da-de-da #

596
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:09,507
# Even though you go # # And this romantic glow may fade #

597
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:14,500
# One dream you'll never sever #

598
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:20,051
# 'Cos when you're gone # # I'll hear your serenade #

599
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:26,752
# Echoing in my heart forever #

600
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:35,000
# Blow it low, slow and tender #

601
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:41,154
# Let my soul respond in sweet surrender #

602
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:48,955
# There it goes, I hear a call #

603
00:41:53,656 --> 00:41:55,156
# To arms #

604
00:42:23,336 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh Ella, the magnificent boy?

605
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,501
Last time I was here it was just wonderful.

606
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:31,000
But that was two weeks ago.

607
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:35,100
It was fantastic, Skiddy!

608
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:40,950
You can stop smiling, Georgie. He's not ready for Broadway yet.

609
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:44,200
- Besides, he has a contract with me. - Contracts can be broken, Murphy.

610
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:46,601
- And necks too. - What are you implying?

611
00:42:46,602 --> 00:42:48,700
Why? Your rubber ?

612
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:52,000
You're taking a risk by letting yourself fall in love with a guy like Skid.

613
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:53,801
- What's wrong with him? - Everything.

614
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:57,100
I know he's sweet, he's fun, but...

615
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:01,400
Seems a little unstable to me. In an emergency, it doesn't resist.

616
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:04,000
As you know? Have you ever seen Skid in an emergency?

617
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,499
I don't need to. They're all the same.

618
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,900
I thought you had more sense.

619
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:13,601
But giving up on that guy with a ranch in California...

620
00:43:13,602 --> 00:43:16,200
I'm not kidding about Skid. I know it's not perfect.

621
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:20,400
Just want to have fun and have fun. It works for me.

622
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,401
It doesn't do any good.

623
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:24,200
- Let's say you got sick. - But I'm not.

624
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,700
All right, but let's say.

625
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:27,842
- If I sent Skid after a doctor... - He would.

626
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:31,273
Of course, I would look for the best doctor in town.

627
00:43:31,294 --> 00:43:33,800
Not before stopping at the first bookmaker.

628
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,401
And if it were, I would win.

629
00:43:36,102 --> 00:43:38,000
It's no use.

630
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:52,800
What are you complaining about? This was not your doing.

631
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,700
No need to be offended. Skid should be arriving by now.

632
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,601
You better hurry, I need to get back to my boat.

633
00:44:04,402 --> 00:44:06,902
You know Skid, love an encore.

634
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:10,400
Hey, how many of these do you want?

635
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,401
You can keep working, Ella.

636
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:16,492
- Is your family in the navy? - No, why?

637
00:44:16,543 --> 00:44:18,823
He is always traveling by ship.

638
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,400
It's true. And I always dreamed of living on a chicken farm.

639
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:27,701
- I don't know if it would work very well. - Why?

640
00:44:27,742 --> 00:44:30,500
I don't know, I think chickens don't like me very much

641
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:42,300
Too bad Skid didn't come back. It's delicious.

642
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:48,100
He couldn't have gone to Pallera. They wouldn't let him in.

643
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:52,000
And why would I come back? Let him have his fun, he doesn't owe us anything.

644
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:55,101
He owes me a dollar and a half. But it ends up paying me.

645
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:59,402
It pays, yes. He only makes debts in cash.

646
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:02,903
He never takes on personal debts.

647
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,304
At least it doesn't promise to give what it can't.

648
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,400
You want to feel free and don't hide from anyone.

649
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,599
Good life, for those who like it. A good life...

650
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,100
You're right... for those who like it.

651
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:19,700
- There's a little left, do you want? - Yes thanks.

652
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:24,400
I thought he would change after he met you.

653
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:27,401
Anyway, Skid always liked something new.

654
00:45:32,702 --> 00:45:34,200
What was it?

655
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:48,601
Sra. Murphy.

656
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:50,602
- Who is it? - Maggie.

657
00:45:54,003 --> 00:45:55,950
- Have you seen Skid? - Yes, I've seen that.

658
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:59,800
He left here hours ago with that little minx Anita Alvarez.

659
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:00,901
Ah...

660
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,200
Murphy, you better know. Skid has every right to do as he pleases.

661
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:07,401
We are not married. We just said we were.

662
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:10,000
... I guessed.

663
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:12,701
And you're in love with him. I guessed too.

664
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:15,950
Yes, I am in love. What's his problem, Murphy?

665
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,101
Whenever he seems to be in love with me at the same time he is resentful.

666
00:46:21,202 --> 00:46:22,702
No way to understand.

667
00:46:22,723 --> 00:46:24,850
Because I understand. You're good for him.

668
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:26,700
And that's hard for a guy like him.

669
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:29,601
Maggie, take my advice and get out.

670
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:30,900
R�pido.

671
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:42,300
- Four bottles of liquor. - Four of liquor.

672
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:44,700
- Tr s de Cura ao. - Tr s de Cura ao.

673
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,600
You're in love with her, aren't you?

674
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:49,101
Me?

675
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:53,100
Why did you want to go out with me then?

676
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:57,500
- Because I had an appointment with her. - Makes a lot of sense.

677
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:58,700
It makes perfect sense.

678
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:01,401
I was going to call a doctor but I passed a bookmaker on the way.

679
00:48:05,202 --> 00:48:06,300
Skid.

680
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,000
Sim?

681
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:12,401
- Still awake? - Yes I am.

682
00:48:13,402 --> 00:48:16,602
Ella was telling me about a great job in New York.

683
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,503
I thought about accepting it.

684
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:27,200
Did you judge, ? I should have done this weeks ago.

685
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:33,300
Yeah, you're right.

686
00:48:38,701 --> 00:48:40,001
Maggie.

687
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,000
Won't you scold me for not coming home?

688
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:48,400
Maggie?

689
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,301
Good night, Skid.

690
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,502
Goodnight.

691
00:49:17,403 --> 00:49:19,500
I want a ticket to New York.

692
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:54,701
Hi.

693
00:49:56,502 --> 00:49:58,700
Did you buy your ticket?

694
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:01,101
Yes, I did.

695
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:12,200
Harry will take you to the docks. I hate goodbyes.

696
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:13,901
Me too.

697
00:50:14,102 --> 00:50:16,202
Well, I hope you make a...

698
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:19,203
Goodbye.

699
00:50:19,204 --> 00:50:21,604
No need to say goodbye yet. I'm only traveling tomorrow.

700
00:50:21,695 --> 00:50:23,605
You better say goodbye now.

701
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:26,206
Goodbye, soldier.

702
00:50:28,807 --> 00:50:31,400
Maggie, before I leave, I want you to know.

703
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:33,701
I think you are wonderful.

704
00:50:34,302 --> 00:50:36,702
It's sensible, it's cool...

705
00:50:37,803 --> 00:50:39,903
o feia ...

706
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,204
I think I'm beautiful.

707
00:50:43,205 --> 00:50:44,805
Yeah, you're right.

708
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:46,806
Nice time to tell me.

709
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Me...

710
00:50:51,701 --> 00:50:56,801
I'm the kind of guy who... Well, the kind Ella talked about.

711
00:51:00,502 --> 00:51:01,702
But listen...

712
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:05,703
Listening...

713
00:51:07,404 --> 00:51:11,050
We could get away after our number soon. Nobody would notice. We...

714
00:51:11,092 --> 00:51:12,952
It doesn't take long to get married and...

715
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:15,753
when we got back no one would know.

716
00:51:16,654 --> 00:51:18,000
Do you agree?

717
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,700
Skid Johnson, are you doing okay?

718
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:23,000
I don't know, my stomach is flipping.

719
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:28,201
Poxa, Maggie.

720
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:37,602
# Let my soul respond in sweet surrender #

721
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:45,000
# There it goes, I hear a call... #

722
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:56,600
# To arms # Yeah!

723
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,700
Go comb your hair. It's horrible. Meet you in 5 minutes.

724
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:05,300
I'm debuting my spanish shawl too, isn't it wonderful?

725
00:52:08,054 --> 00:52:09,945
- Are you leaving? - Yes.

726
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:11,052
�timo.

727
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:15,389
I got a job in New York, at El Greco, you know?

728
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:18,051
Yes, I do. And does El Greco know you?

729
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,948
- You know my reputation. - Who doesn't know?

730
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:24,400
If you and Skid are passing through New York, be sure to look for me, huh?

731
00:52:24,499 --> 00:52:25,628
N�o.

732
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:29,200
- Are you speaking for yourself or for Skid? - I speak for both of us!

733
00:52:29,776 --> 00:52:32,100
- You're pretty sure of yourself, huh? - Hmm-hmm.

734
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:36,741
Listen here, Skid likes a change. One day here, another there.

735
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,746
That's why you don't worry me a bit.

736
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:41,300
With Skid just wait your turn.

737
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:43,500
You are wonderful, really wonderful.

738
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:46,000
And it looks beautiful, but your hair is falling down that side.

739
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:50,400
Harvey, I can't believe it! Good to see you!

740
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:51,800
Good to see you too, Marguerite.

741
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:55,499
You look great, but who knew... How did you know I was here?

742
00:52:55,516 --> 00:52:59,800
A girl sent me this telegram, look...

743
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:01,001
Hm ... Her.

744
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,499
Yes, she said she was stranded here when she came to meet me.

745
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,800
She shouldn't have said anything. Harvey, I...

746
00:53:05,864 --> 00:53:09,650
Listen here. I'm not kidding myself. I know you don't love me,

747
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,200
otherwise you would have married me a long time ago.

748
00:53:11,286 --> 00:53:12,507
But Harvey, you don't understand...

749
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:17,300
I understand, yes. But I'm so in love that just having her by my side makes me happy.

750
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,300
- But Harvey... - Come on, Maggie, we don't have much time.

751
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:22,499
Skid, this is Harvey Howell, a good friend of mine. Skid Johnson.

752
00:53:22,642 --> 00:53:25,200
Nice to meet you. We are in a hurry, let's get married.

753
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,499
- To marry? - Yes, tonight.

754
00:53:27,565 --> 00:53:29,500
Maggie insisted it be today, Washington's birthday.

755
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,600
Who's gonna lie one of these days?

756
00:53:31,636 --> 00:53:34,100
Come with us. Harry is waiting and we need two witnesses.

757
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,686
He's a friend of mine, Maggie knows you, so...

758
00:53:36,726 --> 00:53:37,826
Skid.

759
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:42,012
- No, no... I'd love to, Marguerite, but... - Great, come on, come on.

760
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:48,800
The same in poverty as in wealth, both in pain and in joy,

761
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:50,500
Until death separates them.

762
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:55,300
Repeat after me: In wealth as in poverty...

763
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,200
In wealth and poverty...

764
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,100
Until death do us part...

765
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:01,082
Until death do us part.

766
00:54:01,365 --> 00:54:02,663
J is married.

767
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:04,917
We are married!

768
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,499
Best wishes, sir.

769
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:09,336
Best wishes.

770
00:54:10,275 --> 00:54:12,000
You have to kiss the bride.

771
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,001
Murphy! Open the door!

772
00:54:35,145 --> 00:54:37,739
We only open at nine. The tree is not ready yet.

773
00:54:38,246 --> 00:54:39,712
And at nine, pull your beard!

774
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:42,499
Okay, but there's an oven.

775
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:44,800
Hot or cold, Christmas, play your part!

776
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:47,560
- Come on, quick with these decorations. - Yes ma'am.

777
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:55,429
- Peter. - Madam?

778
00:54:55,698 --> 00:54:57,533
More sugar. Fast!

779
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:02,500
Carlos and Gonzales, get this paperwork out of here.

780
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,901
Quick, girls, we need to open the house.

781
00:55:09,002 --> 00:55:12,202
# If it's not a flame #

782
00:55:12,603 --> 00:55:15,803
# Burning night and day #

783
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:19,404
# Then it's nothing more than a game #

784
00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:22,805
# Children can play # # But I'm not that way #

785
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:26,906
# My heart #

786
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:32,907
# Never was taken # # You can take it but beware #

787
00:55:34,608 --> 00:55:39,708
# My heart's never been broken #

788
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:43,300
# If you break it... # # I don't care #

789
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:48,701
# Then I'll know #

790
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:52,902
# That it's really love #

791
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:57,803
# And I won't complain #

792
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:01,804
# If it's really love #

793
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:08,605
# It's worth the pain #

794
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,727
Gosh, I need to decorate better.

795
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:16,319
Yeah, those things weren't there.

796
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:17,241
I know!

797
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:18,432
The voice wasn't good either.

798
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,013
No need to rub it in your face.

799
00:56:20,313 --> 00:56:21,409
Typical woman.

800
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,700
Why are you so cruel to me at Christmas?

801
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,000
- Cruel? Who? - You!

802
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:32,342
Oh, honey, I was just kidding. Sing as you like.

803
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:35,300
- My voice is horrible. - No, it's really cool.

804
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:38,526
- Do you have a handkerchief? - No, you didn't wash your clothes.

805
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:41,700
- Oh, honey, sorry. Tomorrow I wash. - I help.

806
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,500
Here, I can help too.

807
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:44,943
Thank you, Harry.

808
00:56:48,734 --> 00:56:52,200
I love Christmas. We should have brought Butch to see Santa Claus.

809
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:54,100
He's too old for Santa Claus.

810
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:55,666
It hasn't been a year since he's been at home.

811
00:56:56,034 --> 00:56:57,129
Seems a lot longer, doesn't it?

812
00:56:57,304 --> 00:56:58,312
What?

813
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,600
It doesn't... I mean... it doesn't seem like that long, does it?

814
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:03,167
Typical man. Thank you, Harry.

815
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:05,100
Lend me your comb.

816
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:08,800
Now that peace has returned, can we repeat the introduction?

817
00:57:09,027 --> 00:57:10,322
Come on him.

818
00:57:14,655 --> 00:57:18,474
In this guy's hands, Steak would make it to the top of the charts.

819
00:57:18,956 --> 00:57:22,851
My clientele only increases with it.

820
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:24,518
Hmm...

821
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:28,100
I see she's still at El Greco.

822
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:30,100
I wonder how they still haven't figured out which one is hers.

823
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:31,499
- Who? - Alvarez.

824
00:57:31,554 --> 00:57:35,100
He wished us a Merry Christmas and regrets that we are still here.

825
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:37,802
Well, no need! Did you like the new number?

826
00:57:38,484 --> 00:57:39,895
So like that.

827
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,898
It's impossible to get a compliment from Murphy.

828
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:45,000
That's because you're too smart.

829
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:47,980
If Skid despises this opportunity, he will be despising his chances on Broadway,

830
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:49,499
which is my goal.

831
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,050
But ask if he listens to me.

832
00:57:51,118 --> 00:57:54,300
- Of course. - Of course not.

833
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:58,000
Are you saying you offered him a contract in New York and he turned it down?

834
00:57:58,051 --> 00:58:00,800
I already have a house tacked up, contract and all. A steak.

835
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:03,499
Don't worry, he'll accept.

836
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:05,499
When would we go?

837
00:58:05,663 --> 00:58:07,099
Well, dear...

838
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,600
the market is saturated with women. Also, Skid has something different.

839
00:58:11,803 --> 00:58:13,988
Something that will put the city on its toes, understand?

840
00:58:15,271 --> 00:58:16,656
Yes I understand.

841
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:21,106
Going ahead to get used to it, then he would send for you.

842
00:58:21,384 --> 00:58:23,200
Until then you keep your job here...

843
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:26,700
and if he finds his asses in the water, he'll always have a place to go back to.

844
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,650
Doesn't it make sense?

845
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,600
It makes sense, of course. It's too good to refuse.

846
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:34,401
But I need to talk to him.

847
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,000
Harry, cad� o Skid?

848
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,112
- Well, he... he, uh... - Thank you.

849
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:45,700
- And there? - What are you taking, Skid?

850
00:58:45,758 --> 00:58:46,700
He's already taken it.

851
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,400
- Two. - It's too much.

852
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:49,950
Now, Maggie, but it's Christmas today.

853
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:52,600
Last time was your birthday, there was Butch's birthday.

854
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:54,900
Every day is a holiday soon. Where are we going to stop?

855
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,201
The bar closed.

856
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:59,200
You need to take care of health in your state.

857
00:58:59,587 --> 00:59:01,100
What state?

858
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,499
You don't know it yet, but you're going to become a star. I just resolved.

859
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:07,100
Now thank the man and tell him he'll go to New York with pleasure.

860
00:59:07,198 --> 00:59:08,900
Ah, n�o.

861
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,100
But Skid, soon you send for me.

862
00:59:11,101 --> 00:59:12,600
You can't miss this chance.

863
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,200
I already told him I don't want to go to New York.

864
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:18,200
I like here. We're fine, it's fun.

865
00:59:18,241 --> 00:59:20,600
Want to spend the rest of your life playing in this joint?

866
00:59:20,649 --> 00:59:21,499
Why not?

867
00:59:21,534 --> 00:59:24,400
Doesn't it mean anything to you to become a star, to be successful?

868
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:26,200
And what to do with success?

869
00:59:26,247 --> 00:59:29,400
But, honey, you will be a sensation, a sensation indeed!

870
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:31,200
I'm already a sensation here, isn't that enough?

871
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:32,600
- Well. - No, Murphy.

872
00:59:32,641 --> 00:59:35,000
Maggie wants me to come to New York. Even if I wanted, I couldn't, right?

873
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:36,800
- Tell her. - For what? What stops you?

874
00:59:36,821 --> 00:59:39,500
- See? - Why, you hired me.

875
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:42,000
? Well listen here, boy.

876
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:44,500
My contracts aren't worth the paper they're written on.

877
00:59:44,553 --> 00:59:47,400
My lawyer takes care of it. Good luck, boy.

878
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,450
Thanks, Murphy.

879
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:53,100
I even have a house for you, what a house! El Greco, you know, right?

880
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,138
Yes, I've heard...

881
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:00,939
Visitors disembarking! Visitors disembarking!

882
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,700
Better take those pills, Skid.

883
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:12,499
It will come in handy if I'm a failure.

884
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,300
Have more, they're very good.

885
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:18,502
- I'm already a failure... - I know, there's always the army.

886
01:00:19,252 --> 01:00:22,500
I better land. I'm already starting to get seasick.

887
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:23,900
- Goodbye, Harry. - Goodbye.

888
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,100
- Better stick with the lemon one. - No, thanks.

889
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:32,200
Wow, Maggie, I don't know how to say goodbye. I never said goodbye to you.

890
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:34,700
We'll never say goodbye soon.

891
01:00:36,352 --> 01:00:38,900
I hope we're not making a big mistake.

892
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,400
Take that money, Skid.

893
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:45,175
- I can't accept this... - But I don't have to.

894
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,624
I don't want you to miss anything.

895
01:00:46,952 --> 01:00:49,800
If it doesn't work, you'll be able to get back, okay, darling?

896
01:00:51,611 --> 01:00:53,779
Ah, I love you so much.

897
01:00:57,711 --> 01:01:01,199
- See you later, darling. - See you later, Maggie.

898
01:01:02,918 --> 01:01:05,200
- I feel lost without you already. - None of that, darling.

899
01:01:05,924 --> 01:01:07,318
Goodbye.

900
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:10,500
- Come on lady, you need to go down. - I know I know.

901
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,924
Goodbye honey. Leave me!

902
01:01:19,652 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm afraid.

903
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:32,700
I'm looking for you soon. Leave the bad ones ready.

904
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,400
All right, darling, let it go.

905
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:40,896
Give the Butch to Murphy.

906
01:02:17,637 --> 01:02:19,957
What does he have that I don't have?

907
01:02:20,314 --> 01:02:21,999
Curly hair. Come on.

908
01:02:24,086 --> 01:02:27,300
Good night, Mr. Howell. Your table is ready.

909
01:02:28,218 --> 01:02:30,950
- I thought it was our table. - Sorry, will have to wait.

910
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:39,500
# Let my soul respond in sweet surrender #

911
01:02:40,601 --> 01:02:45,201
# There it goes, I hear a call... #

912
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:47,700
Higher.

913
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,900
Higher.

914
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:52,200
Higher.

915
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:54,601
Higher. Higher.

916
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:12,000
# To arms #

917
01:03:18,948 --> 01:03:20,057
Skid conquers the city.

918
01:03:20,155 --> 01:03:23,772
As expected, Skid Johnson and his magical trumpet fill El Greco's nights.

919
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,052
We have to prepare a scrapbook.

920
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:28,900
- And it still looks good in the photos. - Listen to this.

921
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,100
"New York public bought me. Get ready to travel in a week."

922
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:32,680
"Te amo. Skid." Que tal?

923
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:34,544
I just don't understand why wait a week.

924
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,600
Need to refund Georgie, buy new clothes.

925
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,057
Would you like to see him in New York walking around like a rag?

926
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,482
I wouldn't want to see you walking around New York period.

927
01:03:41,508 --> 01:03:43,400
Maggie, a letter for you.

928
01:03:43,491 --> 01:03:47,563
Oh, see? It won't even give me time to prepare.

929
01:03:47,678 --> 01:03:50,000
Isn't it nice that he's already saved so much money to send for me?

930
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,600
- A miracle. - .

931
01:03:55,553 --> 01:03:58,641
It's from Harvey, it's in New York.

932
01:03:59,642 --> 01:04:03,800
Says he saw Skid and says it's a tremendous success. I knew it!

933
01:04:24,942 --> 01:04:28,817
Dear Maggie, you must have thought I died.

934
01:04:29,227 --> 01:04:32,349
Next week I will send the ticket.

935
01:04:37,932 --> 01:04:40,400
Come on, Skid, we're gonna lose the fight.

936
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:41,600
Wait, I have to send a telegram.

937
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:44,300
Come on, we bet big. Then you send it.

938
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:46,137
So remind me to send after the fight.

939
01:04:46,297 --> 01:04:48,300
Sure, sure... Let's go.

940
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,930
- Great horse. - The owner assured me he would win.

941
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,133
- Looks like he screwed you, huh, Skid? - And there goes Maggie's ticket.

942
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:12,634
Hi, nice to see you.

943
01:05:12,852 --> 01:05:14,950
- What are you taking? - The same.

944
01:05:15,051 --> 01:05:17,800
- Look, Skid, they named a sandwich after you.

945
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:19,336
What takes?

946
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:21,348
Ham and cheese.

947
01:05:24,285 --> 01:05:25,610
- Your idea? - It was, yes.

948
01:05:25,711 --> 01:05:26,900
Very funny.

949
01:06:12,663 --> 01:06:14,321
Writing another letter?

950
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,846
Yes, another letter.

951
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,457
This is turning into a monologue, isn't it?

952
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,757
What would you do, Murphy?

953
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,102
What are you going to do, I suppose.

954
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,000
Can I borrow the money?

955
01:06:33,474 --> 01:06:35,300
One hundred twenty-five, isn't it?

956
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:39,171
Are you sure you want to go?

957
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:47,100
Thanks.

958
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,765
Skid, honey, I arrived in Virginia. Dock 61. Come get me.

959
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:02,522
I love you. Maggie.

960
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:11,150
Skid, a telegram has arrived for you. I gave it to Alvarez.

961
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,800
I opened it for you, honey. Just more orders.

962
01:07:16,011 --> 01:07:18,700
This city has more horseshoe faces than the army.

963
01:07:29,057 --> 01:07:33,636
Make way, make way, please.

964
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:38,372
What luck! Skid, you won.

965
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,238
I knew it was just a question of patience.

966
01:07:40,772 --> 01:07:42,011
How much did I earn?

967
01:07:43,912 --> 01:07:45,712
$1,750.

968
01:07:45,957 --> 01:07:48,000
Now I can charter the Queen Mary and call Maggie.

969
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,400
Who is Maggie? Give me a hundred a .

970
01:07:49,442 --> 01:07:51,970
Wonder! How about a celebration?

971
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,525
Let's have a good time.

972
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,926
Are you waiting for someone, miss?

973
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:01,612
What? Ah yes yes. No thanks.

974
01:08:15,297 --> 01:08:16,548
Keep the change.

975
01:08:17,003 --> 01:08:20,066
Come on, I already paid. I already paid.

976
01:08:21,176 --> 01:08:23,333
- Good night. - Good night.

977
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:33,238
Is this your room or mine?

978
01:08:33,499 --> 01:08:34,872
My.

979
01:08:35,796 --> 01:08:38,229
Come on, come on in and have a drink.

980
01:08:38,499 --> 01:08:40,030
Come on, it'll do you good.

981
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,838
Sit here while I make a drink.

982
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:45,695
Call to Hotel Leland, please.

983
01:09:49,596 --> 01:09:50,956
Hotel Leland?

984
01:09:52,007 --> 01:09:54,233
Miss Is Anita lvarez staying there?

985
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:57,534
Could you connect me to your room?

986
01:10:18,203 --> 01:10:19,843
Al�.

987
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:22,758
Al�, � voc�, Skid?

988
01:10:22,794 --> 01:10:25,734
Yes, it's Skid, the one-man army. Who speaks?

989
01:10:29,335 --> 01:10:32,300
Skid speaking, the one-man army. Who speaks?

990
01:10:36,136 --> 01:10:37,736
Who speaks?

991
01:10:39,094 --> 01:10:40,500
Al�?

992
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,296
What happened to him?

993
01:10:57,062 --> 01:10:59,500
Don't you need me anymore?

994
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,500
It was all my fault. I shouldn't have sent you to come.

995
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,690
I'm sorry, honey.

996
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,497
Al ?

997
01:11:21,937 --> 01:11:23,500
Hey, Ella.

998
01:11:23,556 --> 01:11:27,462
I just got your telegram. He almost doesn't catch me because...

999
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,923
Well, listen and don't laugh.

1000
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:34,000
Married? Ella, how wonderful!

1001
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:37,550
Harry and I, can you believe it?

1002
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:40,900
- Send my regards. - Yes, I do.

1003
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:43,300
What was it? Are you crying?

1004
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,687
No, I'm laughing.

1005
01:11:48,749 --> 01:11:50,286
Have you seen Skid?

1006
01:11:50,362 --> 01:11:52,000
Skid?

1007
01:11:53,001 --> 01:11:55,000
Ah, we're getting divorced.

1008
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:58,601
Oh, I don't know. It's been so long since he left.

1009
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,200
That things happen.

1010
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:03,635
Well, until he finally came to his senses.

1011
01:12:22,216 --> 01:12:25,033
Is Mr. Harvey Howell still staying there?

1012
01:12:27,124 --> 01:12:29,234
I would like to speak with him.

1013
01:12:32,907 --> 01:12:36,114
- My wife? - Like I said. You've already called three times.

1014
01:12:36,598 --> 01:12:39,499
No, my wife is in Panama. This letter is hers.

1015
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,816
- Must be some girl's prank call. - .

1016
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:06,755
I was the one who called you this morning. I don't think there's more to say.

1017
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:11,337
I'm just going to ask for a divorce. Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

1018
01:13:11,499 --> 01:13:13,736
Good luck, soldier. Maggie.

1019
01:13:16,471 --> 01:13:18,222
Oh, n�o, Maggie.

1020
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:27,500
Last night and the day before yesterday, all day today,

1021
01:13:27,531 --> 01:13:29,687
It's just what he's been doing, reading this letter.

1022
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:34,900
He's been reading this letter for a week. It's too long for any letter.

1023
01:13:34,976 --> 01:13:37,800
The letter is mine, isn't it? I can read as much as I want.

1024
01:13:37,944 --> 01:13:42,100
Okay, but the bosses at the house where you think you work are pretty pissed off.

1025
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,100
If you don't show up today, they'll fire you.

1026
01:13:44,864 --> 01:13:48,200
Hey, are you listening to me? You've also read it dozens of times...

1027
01:13:48,532 --> 01:13:51,503
"SKID JOHNSON'S WIFE DIVORCES IN FRANCE.

1028
01:13:51,704 --> 01:13:54,600
"ON RETURN, HE MARRIES RICO LIVESTOCK."

1029
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,300
...and it will always be the same: she leaves tomorrow at Normandy.

1030
01:14:00,734 --> 01:14:03,300
I think I'd give a shit if I were going to say goodbye to her.

1031
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,980
Better leave things as they are.

1032
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:09,700
Leave her alone.

1033
01:14:13,456 --> 01:14:16,726
This Harvey guy can't be pissed off just wanting to say goodbye to her.

1034
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,737
Maybe it's a good idea.

1035
01:14:21,314 --> 01:14:24,453
I just want to say goodbye, say a few things...

1036
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:27,499
Say goodbye.

1037
01:14:32,082 --> 01:14:33,280
Let's go.

1038
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:38,005
- What do you need me for? - Come on, bring Tony with you.

1039
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:42,200
Why get divorced in France? Doesn't our divorce work?

1040
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,900
Harvey's attorney made the decision.

1041
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,679
- Did you tell Skid? - I wrote to him.

1042
01:14:46,802 --> 01:14:48,622
- How did he react? - I didn't get an answer.

1043
01:14:49,038 --> 01:14:53,100
- He was never much for writing letters. - He was never much of anything.

1044
01:14:53,204 --> 01:14:55,200
Trumpet he plays very well.

1045
01:14:55,265 --> 01:14:57,400
How long do these French divorces take?

1046
01:14:57,499 --> 01:15:01,500
I don't know. But Paris will be fun. I've never been there.

1047
01:15:01,574 --> 01:15:03,800
I was there with my first ma...

1048
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:06,400
(my first husband)

1049
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:09,121
Maggie!

1050
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,000
Ei, o Skid.

1051
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,900
What do I do now?

1052
01:15:13,932 --> 01:15:15,150
Let him knock. You are not.

1053
01:15:15,232 --> 01:15:16,600
There's no point being unfriendly.

1054
01:15:16,658 --> 01:15:19,528
If you continue to help him with every setback he has...

1055
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,450
will end up hurting Harvey.

1056
01:15:21,477 --> 01:15:23,633
- But it could be a problem. - Maggie.

1057
01:15:38,581 --> 01:15:40,253
- How did you get in? - last

1058
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,620
Hi, girl, you look magnificent.

1059
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,621
Hey, this is Georgie Herbert, my agent. Do you remember him?

1060
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:44,902
Hi, Miss Johnson, nice to see you.

1061
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,584
And this one is Tony, he's out to have fun. Laugh, Tony.

1062
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:50,700
- Ha ha, he kills me. - Enough, Tony.

1063
01:15:50,778 --> 01:15:51,874
Sure.

1064
01:15:51,972 --> 01:15:54,600
You don't change, huh, Ella. Nice to see you.

1065
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:56,429
- Hi, Harry. - Good to see you, Skid.

1066
01:15:56,462 --> 01:15:58,600
Sounds like old times in Panama, huh?

1067
01:15:58,631 --> 01:16:00,400
Harry, you look great! Some problem?

1068
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,150
- Me and Ella got married. - No!

1069
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,400
Well, whoever says a baby is born every minute is right, huh, Tony?

1070
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:07,700
- He's very funny. - Sure.

1071
01:16:07,716 --> 01:16:09,000
You know me well, Ella.

1072
01:16:09,036 --> 01:16:11,600
- Do I serve now, sir? - No thanks, I used to be a waiter too.

1073
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,639
Thank you sir.

1074
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:15,050
And don't worry, one day you might end up like me.

1075
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,100
Thank you sir.

1076
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,900
I was right to bring these drinks. We have a lot to celebrate.

1077
01:16:20,237 --> 01:16:21,499
- This is yours, beautiful. - No, thanks.

1078
01:16:21,513 --> 01:16:23,900
Come on, this is Skid's farewell party for Maggie.

1079
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:28,912
By the way, I bought you a present.

1080
01:16:31,156 --> 01:16:32,400
Why didn't you go up alone?

1081
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:35,095
I couldn't get rid of these guys. They've been with me since yesterday.

1082
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:38,254
Yesterday? I haven't known what a bed is for a week.

1083
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:39,989
The king of nights, huh?

1084
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:42,359
People want to see me, don't they?

1085
01:16:42,517 --> 01:16:44,000
Where did you get the black eye?

1086
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:46,400
- I slapped my knee with applause. - Whose knee?

1087
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,401
You should have seen the other guy, Ms. Johnson.

1088
01:16:48,455 --> 01:16:50,000
That's what I thought.

1089
01:16:50,092 --> 01:16:51,950
Stop berating me. I'm getting along fine, aren't I?

1090
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,982
For sure. Everyone already knows you've been sent away.

1091
01:16:55,552 --> 01:16:57,600
Cut that one. Now you have another guy to worry about.

1092
01:17:00,569 --> 01:17:02,065
Are you getting married soon?

1093
01:17:02,686 --> 01:17:04,402
I need to get divorced first, don't you?

1094
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:05,900
Yeah, you're right.

1095
01:17:06,472 --> 01:17:08,399
- Hey, you've been crying. - I didn't cry, no!

1096
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,331
Don't fool me, I've seen her cry many times.

1097
01:17:11,176 --> 01:17:13,499
If it's for me don't put too much water.

1098
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,800
Say, honey, is that good?

1099
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:19,000
- You need to play to earn yours, professor. - It wouldn't be the first time.

1100
01:17:19,308 --> 01:17:20,861
If it weren't for me, I wouldn't play with this swing.

1101
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,669
So you were a teacher, huh?

1102
01:17:25,006 --> 01:17:27,700

01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:30,900
- Remember? Maggie. - I remember, yes.

1104
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:34,499
What was it?

1105
01:17:34,538 --> 01:17:37,400
Nothing. I just remembered how much fun we had writing the lyrics.

1106
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:40,300
It's true.

1107
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,900
That number was a huge hit in Panama, huh, Georgie?

1108
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,901
No!

1109
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,900
Remember when I pawned my trumpet and you had to ask...?

1110
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,850
Did we get that $5 back to Murphy?

1111
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,974
Yes, I paid.

1112
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:53,200
Who is Murphy?

1113
01:17:53,288 --> 01:17:55,250
She is the owner of the house where we work in Panama.

1114
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,273
She's Butch's mom now.

1115
01:17:56,334 --> 01:17:57,900
Butch is our cock.

1116
01:17:58,036 --> 01:18:00,200
That cock almost kills Harry.

1117
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:03,499
This is funny. A rooster tried to kill you?

1118
01:18:05,131 --> 01:18:07,934
- But someone almost killed him too. - That was crazy.

1119
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:09,900
I almost set the house on fire and you know what they did?

1120
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:12,499
They put the animal in a drawer and went to sleep.

1121
01:18:12,539 --> 01:18:14,700
I never understood why you wanted goats.

1122
01:18:14,808 --> 01:18:16,927
Goats? Goats indoors?

1123
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:20,800
What a night it was! Maggie took off her hat...

1124
01:18:20,843 --> 01:18:24,200
We ended up in jail and he had to imitate a ship so we could get out.

1125
01:18:25,612 --> 01:18:27,622
Skid, show how you did it.

1126
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,500
The judge was Spanish and Maggie had to take the boat.

1127
01:18:29,643 --> 01:18:32,600
I couldn't say "boat" so I tried to imitate it like that.

1128
01:18:34,857 --> 01:18:36,800
- Ol�, Maggie. - Oi, Harvey!

1129
01:18:41,205 --> 01:18:44,400
- Having a party, Maggie? - No, no, come in, Harvey.

1130
01:18:44,436 --> 01:18:46,600
- Ol�, Sr. Howell. - Ol�, Ella.

1131
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:49,193
- How are you, Howell? - Hi, Skid.

1132
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,500
This is Mr. Howell, a rancher from the wild west.

1133
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:57,204
How are you, Mr. Howell? Much pleasure. Skid's friend is my friend.

1134
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,080
Harvey, you know Harry.

1135
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:02,282
Of course, we were witnesses at Skid's wedding, didn't we?

1136
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:04,800
Yes, it's true.

1137
01:19:05,382 --> 01:19:07,815
What a wedding. We didn't even know what the guy was talking about.

1138
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:11,699
Maybe we're not even married and you guys are going to all this trouble for nothing.

1139
01:19:11,775 --> 01:19:13,000
It would be funny, wouldn't it?

1140
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:15,450
- Harvey, take it for yourself. - Thanks.

1141
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:17,550
So, let's all just stand there like this, huh?

1142
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,700
I don't want to spoil the party. They looked pretty excited when I entered.

1143
01:19:21,753 --> 01:19:23,300
Why don't you keep playing?

1144
01:19:23,543 --> 01:19:25,801
Great idea, Mr. Howell. Play, Harry.

1145
01:19:25,853 --> 01:19:28,500
- Yes, play something. - Come on, Harry, play.

1146
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:30,601
Mr. Howell won't want to spoil the party.

1147
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,200
So, okay, how about singing for us?

1148
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:34,000
- No, I... - What do you want her to sing?

1149
01:19:35,401 --> 01:19:36,901
What do you want her to sing, Mr. Howell?

1150
01:19:37,602 --> 01:19:39,752
I think Maggie knows my favorite song.

1151
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:42,153
Of course she knows. Go, sing for him!

1152
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:44,800
- I don't want to sing that... - Do we have to insist? Got slender, ?

1153
01:19:44,801 --> 01:19:47,499
It's not dengo! I sing.

1154
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,799
# If it isn't pain #

1155
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,499
# Then it isn't love #

1156
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,600
# If it doesn't drive you insane #

1157
01:20:18,001 --> 01:20:21,300
# It can't be love #

1158
01:20:23,201 --> 01:20:26,101
# If it's not a flame #

1159
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:30,100
# Burning night and day #

1160
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:34,500
# Then it's nothing more than a game # #

1161
01:20:36,401 --> 01:20:38,300
# I'm not that way #

1162
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:42,400
# My heart #

1163
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:45,700
# Never was taken, come and take it #

1164
01:20:47,001 --> 01:20:48,401
# But beware #

1165
01:20:49,802 --> 01:20:53,000
# My heart... never was... #

1166
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,300
You still don't know how to sing that song, don't you?

1167
01:20:55,301 --> 01:20:56,901
What is this, a funeral?

1168
01:20:57,902 --> 01:20:59,900
This is supposed to be a celebration!

1169
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:01,500
to be happy and happy.

1170
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:03,301
I should be handing over the bride.

1171
01:21:03,302 --> 01:21:04,700
- Stop it, Skid! - Why?

1172
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:06,500
Who has a better idea to deliver the bride?

1173
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:08,101
It just proves that there are no hard feelings.

1174
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:10,300
Why be hurt just because a marriage failed?

1175
01:21:10,301 --> 01:21:12,100
Why not join the festivities?

1176
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,402
Come on, Harry, play the bridal march, loud and strong.

1177
01:21:14,423 --> 01:21:15,900
This is a massive wedding.

1178
01:21:18,011 --> 01:21:19,407
Come on, Harry. Touch!

1179
01:21:21,729 --> 01:21:24,250
- Stop, stop! - No, we're celebrating a wedding!

1180
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,500
Come on, everyone, "Here comes the bride..." Come on, sing!

1181
01:21:27,623 --> 01:21:28,900
Stop, Skid, please.

1182
01:21:30,881 --> 01:21:33,200
Skid, I think you better go now.

1183
01:21:33,919 --> 01:21:35,900
All right, Mr. Howell, I'll be right away. I'm coming.

1184
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:39,193
Calm down, I'll be right away. Bye, Maggie.

1185
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:54,218
- Skid, we've been looking for you everywhere. Do you know what time it is?

1186
01:21:54,546 --> 01:21:56,300
It's almost time for the presentation.

1187
01:21:56,648 --> 01:21:58,000
Go away.

1188
01:21:58,203 --> 01:21:59,900
Skid, acorda!

1189
01:22:00,184 --> 01:22:01,410
Go away from here.

1190
01:22:01,622 --> 01:22:04,257
Skid, listen. If you don't come forward, they'll fire you.

1191
01:22:04,279 --> 01:22:06,616
Didn't you hear what I said? Go away from here!

1192
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,952
He has a son who...

1193
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:43,337
- Oh, Tony. - Ah, ol , Skid.

1194
01:23:43,836 --> 01:23:45,499
Do you have any jobs left over there?

1195
01:23:45,695 --> 01:23:49,300
I told you, Skid, I have good clients. I can't risk it. You know that.

1196
01:23:49,313 --> 01:23:51,400
- All right. - Hey, wait.

1197
01:23:52,413 --> 01:23:55,701
This will be the last time, huh? Now be careful.

1198
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:57,167
Thanks.

1199
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,865
Remember him? It's Skid Johnson.

1200
01:24:02,067 --> 01:24:05,900
Clear. The one with the trumpet. But it looks like it's out of tune now.

1201
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Did you hear that? The guy has a sense of humor.

1202
01:24:13,496 --> 01:24:15,853
United States Army, Recruitment Center

1203
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:26,232
Ol�.

1204
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:27,797
- Can I get your coat? - Yes thanks.

1205
01:24:28,771 --> 01:24:31,107
Oh, there's still another one left for you.

1206
01:24:37,325 --> 01:24:38,421
Leave it to me.

1207
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,100
- Goodbye, Tony. - Goodbye

1208
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,120
See you soon.

1209
01:24:41,152 --> 01:24:43,700
- Hi. - How are you, teacher?

1210
01:24:43,997 --> 01:24:46,229
An agent told me he might find Skid Johnson here.

1211
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,100
He was here a few minutes ago, but he left.

1212
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:53,000
- Would you know where he went? - No, I have no idea.

1213
01:24:53,134 --> 01:24:54,400
Fine thanks.

1214
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:03,613
I used to get my wife mad. She wouldn't accept it.

1215
01:25:03,664 --> 01:25:06,245
- But I just said it as a joke. - Say what?

1216
01:25:06,304 --> 01:25:09,400
- "I can always go back to the army" - But I can't.

1217
01:25:09,623 --> 01:25:10,950
I never thought that...

1218
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:14,516
What did you say?

1219
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:16,970
We can't accept you, you're broken.

1220
01:25:24,176 --> 01:25:27,000
You better get dressed, you're shivering.

1221
01:25:51,196 --> 01:25:52,497
Look where you are!

1222
01:25:52,557 --> 01:25:53,657
No, Skid!

1223
01:25:54,231 --> 01:25:55,333
Ol�, Harry.

1224
01:25:55,753 --> 01:25:59,400
I looked for you everywhere. Alright? You look great.

1225
01:25:59,709 --> 01:26:01,880
- All right. - Skid, I want to make you a proposal.

1226
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,600
- Thank you, but I have to go... - No, first hear my proposal.

1227
01:26:04,643 --> 01:26:06,220
Come on, get in there.

1228
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,993
We formed a really cool band.

1229
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:22,200
We're playing in New Jersey cities. Today will be on Long Island.

1230
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:23,700
That's where we're going.

1231
01:26:24,017 --> 01:26:27,211
Can't jump right now. We are over the bridge across the river.

1232
01:26:27,732 --> 01:26:30,200
Everyone was looking for you.

1233
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:34,600
Today we will be broadcast on the radio. I thought it might give us strength.

1234
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:36,502
Of course you can, Skid.

1235
01:26:41,047 --> 01:26:43,000
You must have lost your mind.

1236
01:26:43,051 --> 01:26:45,900
Do you think it's easy to get a sponsor for a band like that?

1237
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,800
Do you know what a chance like this means to you and Ella?

1238
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:51,600
- You didn't ask for someone by name? - A name that someone will remember.

1239
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:53,020
I remembered.

1240
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:56,300
I struggle to get a radio show, a very enthusiastic sponsor,

1241
01:26:56,355 --> 01:27:00,100
A contract at New York prices, and what do I get in return?

1242
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,300
Johnson, always falling to all fours.

1243
01:27:02,352 --> 01:27:03,824
You've said this before.

1244
01:27:03,911 --> 01:27:07,657
Listen here, the show will air tonight with or without him.

1245
01:27:08,196 --> 01:27:12,225
- Shall we have to play? - Of course, now there's no more to cancel.

1246
01:27:12,744 --> 01:27:15,758
It's your funeral, not mine. You can always find another band.

1247
01:27:23,019 --> 01:27:25,930
Forgotten man's ex-wife from Broadway returns from Paris

1248
01:27:32,452 --> 01:27:34,550
Find out where Ms. Skid Johnson is staying.

1249
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,300
Fast. I need to find her before she leaves town.

1250
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,500
You need to help me, Mrs Johnson.

1251
01:27:43,601 --> 01:27:46,700
He always managed to help Skid, this is his last chance.

1252
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:50,835
Skid is not a bad person. I thought maybe I could...

1253
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,400
- You thought wrong. - All right.

1254
01:27:54,099 --> 01:27:59,256
Well, at least I tried. Are you going to be in town for a long time?

1255
01:27:59,296 --> 01:28:02,027
No, I travel to the coast today. I'm getting married as soon as I get there.

1256
01:28:02,517 --> 01:28:06,607
Better that way. It's good to forget about Skid altogether.

1257
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:08,500
Anyway, maybe he's no good.

1258
01:28:08,561 --> 01:28:11,800
But it's a shame. The guy has a lot of talent.

1259
01:28:12,866 --> 01:28:16,000
But if he nails himself, who will bury himself?

1260
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,100
Goodbye, Mrs Johnson. Good luck and best wishes.

1261
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:21,301
Thanks.

1262
01:28:50,002 --> 01:28:51,499
Never that he'll make it.

1263
01:28:51,561 --> 01:28:53,400
A transmiss�o s� come�a �s 10:00.

1264
01:28:53,468 --> 01:28:57,300
He's out. Come on, let's get something to eat.

1265
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,900
- Maggie. - Oi, Ella.

1266
01:29:03,116 --> 01:29:04,620
How did you find us?

1267
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:08,200
No, tell me. I just got that man. Harry, you had nothing to...

1268
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,650
No, it was Georgie who told me.

1269
01:29:09,688 --> 01:29:11,400
- Oh. - Where is he, Ella?

1270
01:29:12,028 --> 01:29:15,200
Remember those emergencies I told you about?

1271
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:32,499
Only to broadcast from 10:00.

1272
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:54,300
She's still there. See her, Ella?

1273
01:29:54,452 --> 01:29:55,900
Of course I see her.

1274
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,050
Don't fool me. I've been having visions lately.

1275
01:29:59,115 --> 01:30:00,792
I would never deceive you.

1276
01:30:02,398 --> 01:30:03,714
Ol�, Skid.

1277
01:30:06,876 --> 01:30:08,300
Hi, girl.

1278
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:17,100
Let me look at you. You look great.

1279
01:30:17,348 --> 01:30:19,083
Good to see you, Skid.

1280
01:30:21,306 --> 01:30:22,700
Have a drink.

1281
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,600
Um, that's all you're missing.

1282
01:30:36,093 --> 01:30:37,528
Are you ashamed of me?

1283
01:30:38,013 --> 01:30:39,113
N�o, Skid.

1284
01:30:40,054 --> 01:30:41,947
Are you going to scold me?

1285
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:43,800
I wouldn't do that.

1286
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:52,846
You know what? They didn't take me back into the army.

1287
01:30:52,984 --> 01:30:55,700
But now you don't need it anymore. You are going to be a big hit today.

1288
01:30:55,961 --> 01:30:57,250
You need to pull yourself together, Skid.

1289
01:30:57,271 --> 01:31:00,300
The program will air at 10:00 am in New York.

1290
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,700
I can't... I don't know if I can.

1291
01:31:04,955 --> 01:31:07,500
Of course it will. You do, Skid.

1292
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:10,801
Without you Harry and Ella are lost. They were always such good friends.

1293
01:31:10,859 --> 01:31:12,499
You can't turn your back on them now.

1294
01:31:16,212 --> 01:31:18,800
- I'm shivering. - It'll be fine.

1295
01:31:21,427 --> 01:31:23,900
- Do you think? - I'm sure.

1296
01:31:24,707 --> 01:31:28,500
- You thought I played well, didn't you? - You're the best.

1297
01:31:30,703 --> 01:31:32,300
Oh, Maggie...

1298
01:31:33,299 --> 01:31:34,700
Oh, Skid.

1299
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:39,693
You'll be fine, you have to be fine...

1300
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:55,423
All ready, guys?

1301
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,750
Good night people. We're streaming straight from the Harmonia lounge,

1302
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:08,475
the liveliest house outside of New York.

1303
01:32:08,555 --> 01:32:09,554
Or come ar.

1304
01:32:09,634 --> 01:32:11,500
Today we have a surprise for you.

1305
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:14,251
Everyone certainly remembers Skid Johnson and his magic trumpet.

1306
01:32:16,674 --> 01:32:19,600
The band got back together, guys,

1307
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:22,600
and any minute now Skid will be playing for you.

1308
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:27,218
It will be his big comeback, his return to the top of the charts...

1309
01:32:27,344 --> 01:32:29,776
and better than ever. Come on, a round of applause for Skid.

1310
01:32:42,178 --> 01:32:44,900
Let's go guys. A long salvo, a long salvo.

1311
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,001
Steady, soldier.

1312
01:33:31,108 --> 01:33:32,862
Is that your great trumpeter?

1313
01:33:32,955 --> 01:33:36,100
No, it can't be him. Must be someone clowning around.

1314
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,440
Sim.

1315
01:33:56,928 --> 01:33:59,241
Harry, toque "Call of Arms", continue tocando.

1316
01:33:59,485 --> 01:34:01,400
Listen to this, Skid, are you listening?

1317
01:34:01,725 --> 01:34:02,827
Sim.

1318
01:34:02,925 --> 01:34:04,773
Let's do it together, can you hear me?

1319
01:34:04,885 --> 01:34:06,400
No, no, I can't.

1320
01:34:06,453 --> 01:34:09,200
Of course you can. Hold me, like this...

1321
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,300
- But I can't do it, Maggie. - You can, dear. Lean on me.

1322
01:34:14,701 --> 01:34:20,301
# When you blow that horn you thrill me #

1323
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:25,600
# To the marrow of my bones # # You chill me #

1324
01:34:26,201 --> 01:34:27,801
Touch, dear, touch.

1325
01:34:27,802 --> 01:34:34,000
# There it goes # # I hear a call to arms #

1326
01:34:37,501 --> 01:34:42,301
# Oh the bliss each note expresses #

1327
01:34:42,702 --> 01:34:47,702
# Reaching out to me like soft caresses #

1328
01:34:49,803 --> 01:34:55,500
# There it goes # # I hear a call to arms #

1329
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:58,900
You can do it, you can do it.

1330
01:34:59,101 --> 01:35:00,500
I can if you stay.

1331
01:35:00,751 --> 01:35:03,500
I stay, you know. As the man who married us said,

1332
01:35:03,701 --> 01:35:06,400
"In pain and joy until death do us part."

1333
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:10,301
- Joy for me, pain for you. - It's fine with me, darling.

1334
01:35:14,602 --> 01:35:18,900
# Echoing in my heart forever #

1335
01:35:20,701 --> 01:35:25,601
# Blow it slow, and low, and tender #

1336
01:35:25,702 --> 01:35:31,302
# Let my soul respond in sweet surrender #

1337
01:35:33,303 --> 01:35:38,000
# There it goes, I hear a call... #

1338
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:08,000

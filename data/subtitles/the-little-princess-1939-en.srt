3
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,491
Why are they sending
so many soldiers daddy,

4
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,656
if it is only going
to be a little war.

5
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,656
Make those southern boys take us
seriously this time, my darlilng.

6
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:01,496
When they realize how much we want to put a
stop to their nonsense, they'll quiet down.

7
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:07,656
They'd better. Anyhow, when you get
there, you'll stop them won't you daddy?

8
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,456
I'll do my best dear.

9
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,056
We will miss you so.

10
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:32,656
I'll be back and we'll be together
again before you can say knife.

11
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,056
I can say knife a good many times
in a year.

12
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:38,032
At school, you'll have charming little
girls to play with.....

13
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:41,856
books to read, a pony to ride and
after all there will be Emily you know.

14
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,575
Yes, there will be Emily.
And she does look as though

15
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,680
she'd be an understanding
friend, don't you think daddy?

16
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:51,056
With that intelletual look, I'm sure of it.

17
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,858
- Not a very cheeful looking
school, is it daddy? - I'm

18
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,281
afraid nothing would seem very
cheerful to us at the moment.

19
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,816
Well, maybe it will be
better on the inside.

20
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,656
- Of course it will. I'm sorry sir.
- All right, get it out.

21
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:22,533
- The very idea of
delivering a thing like this

22
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:24,880
to the front door.
- Oh look daddy, my pony.

23
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,056
Your employer will answer to this.
Now take him away. Yes, far away!

24
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:31,456
- Oh no daddy.
- Oh, I say. Just a moment.

25
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:35,056
- You are Miss Minchin?
- I am.

26
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:36,456
I'm Captain Crew.

27
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:39,714
I'm afraid of caused you
no end to inconvenience.

28
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,680
You most certainly
have, Captain Crew.

29
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,056
- May I step inside and explain?
- Come in.

30
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,256
- Wait here, I'm returning.
- Very well Captain.

31
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,815
- I'm terribly sorry. I had no
intention of having the pony delivered

32
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,520
inside your house. - There are a
number of things besides the pony.

33
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:59,256
Parcels have been arriving here collect for
your daughter for hours. Follow me please.

34
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:12,904
Apparently you are not
aware, Captain Crew, that I

35
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,680
conduct one of the most
exclusive schools in London.

36
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,959
Yes, yes, I understood.
That is precisely the

37
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,680
reason why I brought
my daughter to you.

38
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:23,013
I would not have gathered
that, by your actions.

39
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,280
Really now,
I'm not entirely to blame.

40
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,718
You see Sara and I,
only just arrived from India.

41
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:29,680
Sara has lived there
practically all her life.

42
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,210
We no more than got here,
when I learned that my regiment was

43
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:34,432
to leave at once for South Africa,
so we had to act in a hurry.

44
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:37,584
But I wrote you and explained
that l do not take young

45
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:40,680
ladies without an interview
and impecable references.

46
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:45,256
I wrote you also, that at the
moment, I have no vacant room.

47
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:49,456
- Well in that case daddy, we may as
well move on. - This is a bit awkward.

48
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:53,430
You see, your letter never
reached me and I'm afraid it never

49
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:56,680
occured to me that any school
wouldn't welcome my little Sara.

50
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,306
If it is a question of my
social standing, my father

51
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:02,880
was Sir George Crew.
You've heard of him, perhaps?

52
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,997
And the best financial
references l can give you would

53
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:08,200
be the director of the South
African Holding Syndicate.

54
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,296
I'm the principal stockholder in the
syndicate.

55
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:16,056
My brother, Captain Crew, a
professor of dramatics.

56
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,056
- How do you do?
- Charmed, I'm sure.

57
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:20,315
- I say, isn't the
Eclipse Diamond mines one

58
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,280
of your holdings?
- One of the most important.

59
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,835
I'm sorry to appear casual Miss
Minchin, but the siutation is

60
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,480
quite distressing. I sail in an
hour to the east Indian docks.

61
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,958
I expect you'll just have to
take me to Africa with you daddy.

62
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:36,280
Well, well and what would a
little girl like you do in Africa?

63
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:39,523
Forgive me Captain Crew.
I'm afraid I've been over zealous. The

64
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:42,280
reputation of my school you know.
One has to be so cautious.

65
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:46,656
But after this interview, I can see at
a glance, she's a dear little child.

66
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:50,856
- It'll be a pleasure to have her with us.
- Does that mean I've got to stay?

67
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,856
Yes dear. You are to have that
privilege. You and your little pony.

68
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:57,156
- What a dear little pony.
- This is made out

69
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,080
to the school.
- Is it enough for the moment.

70
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:02,456
- Oh quite. - I should say it
would. Why it's stupendous.

71
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,598
- I beg your pardon,
but haven't I seen you

72
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:06,680
somewhere before?
- Quite possible my dear Captain.

73
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,417
Your face is most familiar.
Were you ever on the stage? I

74
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,680
seem to associate you with
one of the old music halls.

75
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,145
Musicals? My brother on the stage?
Ridiculous.

76
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,080
Ridiculous indeed,
you're quite right.

77
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:19,256
And now, shall we look at little
Sara's room?

78
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:30,656
Just a moment Miss Rose. This is
Miss Rose, one of my most capable teachers.

79
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:35,456
Captain Crew has done us the honor of
placing his little daughter Sara with us.

80
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,896
How do you do Miss Rose?
How do you do Captain Crew? We

81
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,832
shall do everything we can to
make your little girl happy.

82
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:45,256
Children, we have a new pupil.
Sara Crew. Say how do you do to her.

83
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:48,856
- How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you.

84
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:56,856
Lavina, Jesse, that will do. You
may proceed Miss Rose.

85
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:08,856
- She's just like a little princess, isn't
she? - That's what she is, a princess.

86
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,856
I expect now, some people around
here won't think they're so smart.

87
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:18,256
Oh won't they? Wait and see!
Princess indeed!

88
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:23,456
Fortunately, the room has just been papered
and the fireplace has an excellent draft.

89
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:26,394
- But I thought you
didn't have any rooms? - I

90
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,280
didn't know then what a
dear little girl was coming.

91
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:32,856
Why does that make more rooms daddy?

92
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:40,656
Lady Bengiglis daughter has only recently
vacated the room. Our best suite of course.

93
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:46,456
Do you think you could brighten it up a
bit? I'd like it made as gay as possible.

94
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:50,456
Brought a few things from India. Perhaps
you could buy whatever else is necessary.

95
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,056
With pleasure Captain Crew.

96
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:56,271
- I'd like Sara to ride every
afternoon, if that is all right.

97
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:59,680
Of course. - Fortunately we
have a splendid riding master.

98
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,856
I expect you think I am
completely spoiling the child.

99
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,680
No doubt you're right,
but actually it's good for her.

100
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:08,556
She's much too inclined to
bury her cute little nose in a

101
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,880
book and keep it there until
someone lures her out of it.

102
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:14,162
You see Miss Minchin.
Sara has no mother and we've

103
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,680
never been separated for
more than a few days.

104
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,256
- How touching.
- This is going to be very hard for her.

105
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:26,456
Have no fear Captain Crew. I'm a
mother to all my little girls.

106
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:30,856
And now, I'll leave you to your farewells.

107
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:46,056
- How much longer have we got, daddy?
- Only a few minutes, darling.

108
00:09:55,256 --> 00:10:00,856
- You know me by heart little Sara.
- No daddy, I know you by heart.

109
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:03,656
You're inside my heart.

110
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,656
We're going to be brave, aren't we?

111
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:16,256
I'll tell you what. Let's pretend we're
back in India.

112
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:20,056
And I'm going away with the troop
for a few days. Shall we?

113
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:24,821
We've fought this kind
of battle before, haven't

114
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,880
we? And you never cried
once when I went away.

115
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:32,456
- Remember?
- Yes daddy.

116
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:36,656
But this is going to be our hardest
battle.

117
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:42,056
- But we'll be good soldiers, won't we?
- Yes daddy.

118
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,856
- Shall we say good-bye,
like we used to at home? - Yes daddy.

119
00:10:54,856 --> 00:11:01,456
All right then. Chin up, go to the
window and look out.

120
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:16,456
Say it as we used to.

121
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:22,456
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

122
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:28,256
Any moment, I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

123
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:40,856
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

124
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:49,456
I can't do it this time. I can't do it.

125
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:58,424
- You're crying too.
- I'm afraid that we

126
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:01,480
aren't quite the good
soldiers as we thought.

127
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,656
Oh yes we are.

128
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:09,056
I can do it now.

129
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:18,456
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

130
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:22,856
Any moment I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

131
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:49,656
I will do it! I will! I'll pretend this is
part of a war.

132
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:56,656
You be the enemy and you'll be my
trusty lance. Now ready, aim, fi re.

133
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,456
I guess we'll have to call in the
reserves.

134
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:21,256
- Good-morning.
- Misses speaks Hindu?

135
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:26,056
I've lived in India all my life.

136
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:31,656
Misses is going to live in England now?

137
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:34,474
- Until my father gets
through with making the

138
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,480
boars behave.
- Your father is a soldier?

139
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:42,256
Yes, my father is a captain. Captain
Crew. I'm Sara. What is your name?

140
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:48,456
I am Ram Dass. Servant to the
Honorable Lord Wickham and Lady Surani.

141
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:51,256
Ram Dass!

142
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:56,656
Why are you doddling here? Finish
with that bird and get on with your work.

143
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:00,256
Good-morning.

144
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:03,856
How do you do?

145
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm up here at the window
almost every morning,

146
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,480
in case you want to
talk about India.

147
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:15,055
Good-morning Sara. Oh, good-morning.
Are you ready for breakfast my dear?

148
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,292
Well, I'm trying to be,
but I don't seem to be very

149
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:19,680
good at these buttons.
My thumb get lost in the holes.

150
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:24,656
Here, let me help you. Buttons are
a bother, aren't they?

151
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:29,256
I've never had to button things
before, but I'll learn.

152
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:32,856
Here, put your shoe up. Come in.

153
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:39,256
- Good-morning Becky.
- Good-morning.

154
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,362
- Has the young lady any boots to be done?
- Well,

155
00:14:42,387 --> 00:14:44,880
only the pair I wore
yesterday, I'll get them.

156
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:49,256
I'll get them Miss. Oh I beg your
pardon Miss!

157
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:53,256
- Are you hurt?
- No Miss you mustn't be helping me Miss.

158
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:56,624
Just hold out your arms
and I'll pile them on.

159
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,680
Oh no Miss.
If Miss Minchin was to see.....

160
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:03,456
- Think you can hold two more?
- Yes Miss.

161
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,256
There. There we are. Are you all right?

162
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:13,256
- You take care of all those?
- And she does them beautifully.

163
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:17,656
- I thank you Miss.
- Thank-you for doing my shoes.

164
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:22,056
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

165
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,456
Good-bye Becky. Good-bye.

166
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,060
Well, perhaps this isn't
going to be such a bad

167
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,880
school after all.
With you and Becky here.

168
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:36,176
Oh, we'll have to hurry dear. Miss
Minchin doesn't like anyone to be late.

169
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:40,856
Tell me Miss Rose. Do you think Miss
Minchin could be as cross as she looks?

170
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:44,656
- What will I have to do today?
- Well, after

171
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:47,080
breakfast,
you'll have a class of arithmatic.

172
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:53,056
Then English, then french, history
and geography.

173
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:56,856
I'm going to be a busy person,
aren't I? When do I get to ride my pony?

174
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,656
Later this afternoon. About 4 o'clock.

175
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,856
Children, our new pupil, Sara Crew
will be down shortly.

176
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,022
As you've seen,
Captain Crew is a very delightful

177
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,480
man and their family
is most distinguished.

178
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:15,256
I should expect you to treat her
accordingly. Now you may take your places.

179
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:19,456
- Good-morning.
- Ah, good-morning Sara.

180
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:22,340
- I'm so happy you feel like
joining us this morning.

181
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:24,480
Did you sleep well?
- No I didn't, thank-you.

182
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:30,856
Lavina, you and Jesse will move
down one place.

183
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,044
- Sara will be seated at
my right after this. - Why

184
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:36,480
Miss Minchin,
this has always been my place.

185
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:50,603
For this food,
and all thy bountiful gifts bestowed

186
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:53,480
upon us, we are duly grateful
and do now give thanks.

187
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,980
- Why are you putting salt
on your plate my dear. - Just

188
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,680
in case you plan on asking
me to have one of your eggs.

189
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,778
- Mr. Geoffrey. Shall I saddle
the pony for the wee lassie? - I

190
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:25,280
think not Sandy. We'd best use the
mare for her first few lessons.

191
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:37,256
What luck. The old girl allowed you
to come out.

192
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,456
Sara, this is Mr. Geoffrey Hamilton.
Miss Crew is our new pupil.

193
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:44,256
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

194
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:49,856
I believe I am to teach you to ride.
And that means two bob extra to me.

195
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:55,056
- Is two bob a great deal of money?
- Values are comparative.

196
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,807
- In my present state, it's a fortune.
- Well,

197
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:00,080
in that case,
I guess I'd better be taught.

198
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:06,256
- Is my pony ready? -I think we'd best
start you off on something a little tamer.

199
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:10,856
Then hadn't I better explain things
to my pony. He might feel hurt.

200
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,202
Right you are. Ponies are very
sensitive creatures. Explain the

201
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,080
whole thing to him, thoroughly.
He's right there by the arch.

202
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,881
It may take me some time.
That's all right.

203
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:22,080
We'll wait right
here in the tac room.

204
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:28,656
Hello General.

205
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,056
Are you glad to see me?

206
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:38,633
Well if Mr. Geoffrey is going
to give me something tamer

207
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:41,280
than you, I'm afraid it's not
going to be much of a ride.

208
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:44,106
- Rose something's wrong. What is it?
- Miss

209
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,480
Minchin is taking away
my Thursday afternoons.

210
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:49,656
- But why?
- We must have been seen together.

211
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:53,326
- Well does that mean that I can
never see you alone again? Of course

212
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:56,480
not darling. - No matter what Miss
Minchin says, we'll find a way.

213
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:58,690
I can't understand the woman.
What is she

214
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:00,680
afraid of?
Why shouldn't we see one another.

215
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,310
Gossip I suppose.
She only lives for that school

216
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:05,680
the variety of the propriety
of the snobbisheness.

217
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:08,463
Fiddlesticks. She's afraid of losing
an excellent teacher whom she gets

218
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:11,032
for nothing. I won't stand for it.
I will have a talk with her myself.

219
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:14,456
No darling you mustn't do that.
She'd only discharge us both.

220
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:19,656
She may not have the chance if
things continue to pop in South Africa.

221
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:24,456
- You mean you might go? - Wouldn't you
want me to if they call for volunteers?

222
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:29,456
Of course darling you'd have to.

223
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:35,256
There is nothing to worry about now. This
poor rumpous will never get that serious.

224
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,856
I expect I'll have to make my visit a
little longer.

225
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:04,476
- Oh Mr. Brady is there
one this morning for the

226
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,280
little princess?
- We'll see my child we shall see.

227
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:10,498
Of she don't hear from
her father every so often

228
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:13,480
her eyes get that sad it
hurts me to look in them.

229
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,854
- Have no fear little one.
- There is a letter

230
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:19,080
for her this time.
Oh i'm so glad sir.

231
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,856
- A letter?
- It's from my daddy.

232
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:40,056
- Oh how nice.
- But it isn't.

233
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:46,256
- It's very bad news. Really?
- What's the matter dear?

234
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:49,803
He says the boys are not
behaving as expeted. And

235
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:52,480
he may not get here in
time for my birthday.

236
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:58,656
But that's months old. So many things may
happen before then. He can still come.

237
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:02,928
I'm writing Miss Minchin
to give you ar bithday

238
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:05,680
party such as I should
give you if I were there.

239
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:12,056
You are to go on a regular spree. Buy
anything and everthing your heart desires.

240
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:17,456
Now last and most important of all
my darling....

241
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:22,656
I want you to pause at exactly 2
o'clock on your birthday..

242
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:26,656
..close your eyes and send me a kiss.

243
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:34,056
For my eyes also will also be closed
and I'll be giving you a kiss too.

244
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,656
Isn't he the most wonderful man in
all the world?

245
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:48,656
- With one exception...
- Well Mr. Geoffrey is very nice.

246
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,456
What's that?

247
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:10,456
- Who are they Miss Rose?
- They are volunteers.

248
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:20,803
- Are they going to South Africa too?
- Yes dear,

249
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:23,680
they're going to relieve our
poor soldiers in Maefking.

250
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:26,097
- Is there something the
matter with our soldiers

251
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:28,080
in Mafeking?
- The boars have them all cut off.

252
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:31,656
We were unable to break through
their lines and ger help to them.

253
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,997
They're sick and hungry
dear and desprate.

254
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:38,080
They're holding out like
true British soldiers.

255
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:56,456
Miss Rose my daddy's at Mafeking.

256
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:04,056
Oh darling I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

257
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:12,856
Darling you mustn't cry. I'm sure
he'll be all right.

258
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,912
- Good afternoon Mr. Geoffery.
- Good afternoon

259
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:18,560
Madris.
Is Miss Sarah ready for her ride?

260
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:20,856
She'll be down presently. Thanks.

261
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:24,456
Oh, are we all ready?

262
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:31,456
The two most beautiful ladies in the world.
Why aren't you in your riding things?

263
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:33,865
- Oh i can't go today.
Ermegard needs extra

264
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,080
tutoring today.
- Oh will it take all afternoon?

265
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:37,056
I'm afraid so.

266
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:39,593
- I have to stay with
her until she can spell

267
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:41,680
Constantiniopel.
- Heavens that may take months.

268
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,656
You leave that to me.

269
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:51,256
Shall we go? Have you been
crying?

270
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:56,656
- But you have, there are still tears in
your eyes. - It's just this London fog.

271
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:59,456
Oh well if that's all,
lets be off shall we?

272
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,931
- Mr. Geoffrey.
Would you mind very much if we didn't

273
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:15,680
ride today?
- Not at all dear. But may I ask why not?

274
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,456
I'd like to talk to you.

275
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:23,213
It's about Mafeking.
Are the soldiers really

276
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:25,680
starving,
sickand cut off from everything?

277
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:30,056
- You see my father's there so I've got
to know. - Oh it's not as bad as all that.

278
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:33,338
They may not be having an
easy time of that, but they're

279
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:36,280
holding out. We're sending in
fresh troops everyday you know?

280
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:40,119
- Why they'll be leaving Mafeking
in no time at all. - It's

281
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:43,080
getting harder everyday to
pretend my father is safe.

282
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:47,456
Don't you worry. See here, I'll let
you in on at litle secret.

283
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:51,020
I enlisted today and while I
don't Miss Rose to know quite

284
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,480
yet, I'll be going over
there quite shortly myself.

285
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:58,456
- To Mafeking? Well then perhaps you
can help my father. - We'll get him out.

286
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:05,656
What the blazes are you doing
here? Answer me! What are you doing here?

287
00:26:06,256 --> 00:26:08,842
- Don't be frightened Sara,
it's only my grandfather. - Don't you

288
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,232
believe him young woman.
I disowned him the day he was born.

289
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:13,361
- We're really very fond of each other.
Of course

290
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:15,280
we are.
- What?! We are nothing of the kind.

291
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:18,808
- As a favor to me,
will you please stop shouting at my best

292
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,880
paying pupil. - Pupil? Paying?
What are you talking about?

293
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:26,256
I am master of the horse in this
exclusive seminary of the young ladies.

294
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,230
You take advantage of
my absence to become a

295
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,680
riding master?
And next door to me own house?

296
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:35,309
- Where's your family pride boy?
- Well sir, one

297
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:37,680
must eat, and family pride
is a pretty thin diet.

298
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:40,212
Oh, blackmail eh?
You'll think I'll buy you off?

299
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:42,880
I hadn't thought of that,
but it's not a bad idea.

300
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:46,156
I'll see you hang drawn and
quartered for that. Wait till I see

301
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:49,080
the woman who runs this school.
I'll put a spoke in your wheel.

302
00:26:49,656 --> 00:26:51,804
Do! She loved to know
that my grandfather is

303
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:53,880
Lord Wickham.
She probably raise my salary

304
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:57,256
- Miss Sara, Lord Wickham is coming.
- Then I'm going.

305
00:26:57,656 --> 00:27:03,056
Insolent young pup! Just like his
father. Riding master! Bah!

306
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:09,056
- Maybe you're fond of him,
but I don't think he's very fond

307
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:11,880
of you. - Oh he's harmless.
His bark is worse than his bite.

308
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,056
I should hope so. Why is he so mad at you?

309
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:20,256
Oh he isn't really. He was angry with my
father. I'm mixed up in their quarrel.

310
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:22,898
What he really wants if for
me to come begging to him

311
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:25,080
for help. He'd be eating
out of my hand if I would.

312
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:28,456
I don't think I'd care for him eating
out of my hand.

313
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,032
- How would you like to
have me eating out of

314
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:33,280
your hand?
- You? Oh, that would be different.

315
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:37,856
Well I shall, if you do me a favor.
A very important one. Oh, could I?

316
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,856
I've got an idea that you are the
only one in the world who could.

317
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:46,456
I want you to get Miss Rose to go shopping
with you next Wednesday. Shopping?

318
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:50,256
Well, shopping is as good an
excuse for Miss Minchin.

319
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,456
Really? To Miss Rose?

320
00:27:58,456 --> 00:28:03,256
And she said she would? Oh, that's
wonderful!

321
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:10,256
- No, not a soul. Not even Emily.
- Good girl! Now we've got to go.

322
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,429
- I must do some prelimanary shopping.
- You don't

323
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:16,280
have to tell me what for.
Something gold and shiny.

324
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:18,456
Right you are!

325
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:25,456
Come in.

326
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:35,656
- Come in. - Miss Minchin,
I wanted to ask you something.

327
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:40,856
- Oh, it's you. What do you want dear?
- I'm going to ask you a big favor. Yes?

328
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:45,656
Mr. Geoffrey leaving today for the
war, he's been so very nice to me...

329
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,589
I thought I ought to fill my
social obligations by doing

330
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:51,280
something nice for him.
That's what you teach us, isn't it?

331
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:55,256
When someone shows you a
kindness, you show them one in return.

332
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:57,617
Well doing something for Mr. Geoffrey,
scarcely

333
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,480
comes under the rules
of social obligations.

334
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:03,856
- But what is it that you want to do
for him? - May I have him for tea?

335
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:08,656
- Here? At the school? - Oh couldn't I
please? Since he's going away to war.

336
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:12,438
Well I suppose it would be for him,
since he was one of the teachers.

337
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:15,280
You need not mention this to
the other young ladies, however.

338
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:20,656
No Miss Minchin. Thank-you Miss
Minchin. Oh Thank-you Miss Minchin!

339
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:44,612
- We must eat something
after all the trouble little

340
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:47,080
Sara has gone to.
- I think she'll understand.

341
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:52,456
- You've forgotten your ring.
- No I haven't....see?

342
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:56,469
I'm always afraid I'll forget and
wear it in front of Miss Minchin.

343
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,280
I did yesterday and fortunately for
us, she didn't see it.

344
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:04,256
- Oh I'd love to tell the old girl.
- Can't do that yet darling. I know.

345
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:09,056
- Are you sorry you married me?
- As if you didn't know.

346
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:14,456
I only wanted you to tell me again.
Oh, my darling....

347
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:19,656
I'll be living this last week over
every moment I'm away from you.

348
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:25,856
We won't be separated, will we?
Because I'll be living it over too.

349
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:38,256
- I thought you were having Mr. Hamiliton
to tea? - I am, I mean I was but.....

350
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:41,656
- Who's in that room?
- Oh please don't go in there Miss Minchin.

351
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:52,256
- Miss Minchin, Miss Rose and I.....
- We were saying good-bye Miss Minchin.

352
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,968
How dare you risk the reputation
of my school in this manner.

353
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:59,280
Nothing has happened to damage
your precious school's reputation.

354
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:03,856
- As a matter of fact Miss Rose and I.....
- Geoffrey! For my sake.

355
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:07,856
- Oh please Miss Minchin, it was all
my fault. -Silence!

356
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:13,056
Since you are here to merely say
good-bye, please do so, now.

357
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:25,856
Good-bye Geoffrey.

358
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:38,256
- Good-bye Mr. Geoffrey.
- Good-bye dear.

359
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:47,456
- Sara, I shall expect an explanation
of this. - Yes Miss Minchin.

360
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:50,056
As soon as I can think of one.

361
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:11,055
- They've been cornered like
rats for 7 months. - I say send

362
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,360
more troops to Mafeking if it
takes every man in England.

363
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:17,256
- I'm with you.
- No! Nooooooooo!

364
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:22,256
Oh my boy, my boy, my boooooy....

365
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:26,056
They killed my boy.

366
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:31,456
I know soldiers are suppose to
stand a lot and my daddy is a good soldier.

367
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:36,856
But they've waited so long for help. Please
do something about Mafeking right away.

368
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:41,256
Or they'll all be lost and my daddy
won't come back.

369
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:58,656
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is
set free.

370
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:05,856
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is
set free.

371
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,856
Oh thank-you for being so quick
about it this time.

372
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:19,856
Get up, get up! Mafeking is set free.

373
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:23,656
Wake up everybody! Mafeking is
set free.

374
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:27,508
- Oh Mr. Bertie! Did you hear?
Mafeking is set

375
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:30,080
free!
- Yes darling, isn't it great news.

376
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:34,856
Oh Miss Rose, they're saved. My
daddy and Mr. Geoffrey are saved.

377
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,009
- What's wrong? Nothing is wrong.
- Nothing,

378
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:41,480
nothing, nothing!
Mafeking is set free.

379
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:47,656
Oh Miss Minchin, isn't it wonderful?
Can you hear the cheering?

380
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:15,056
- Oh Sara, I'm so glad for you.
- He's saved Becky! My daddy is saved!

381
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:41,056
Children, children! Attention please!

382
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:46,706
It is a happy circumstance that
Sara's birthday should fall on a day

383
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:50,080
that we are celebrating a glorious
victory for Her Majesty's Army.

384
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:54,856
Now Sara. Will you explain to the children
about your wishes for your birthday?

385
00:34:55,856 --> 00:34:58,709
I'm very happy to have you
here and I thought I would

386
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:01,480
like to give presents today.
Not just receive them.

387
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:06,656
I want to show how grateful I am my father
has been rescued. Quiet children, quiet.

388
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:13,256
- Can we do the presents now?
- Yes, but your gift first Sara.

389
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:19,716
This is for you.
Oh thank-you Miss Minchin.

390
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:22,280
Now all I need is
to know how to sew.

391
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:27,656
And this from the entire school.
Here are pictures of your native India.

392
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,524
Oh thank-you ever and ever so much.
I shouldn't have to

393
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:33,280
pretend nearly so hard when I
want to make believe I'm there.

394
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:37,091
And now, would you like
them to have their presents.

395
00:35:37,116 --> 00:35:40,680
Yes, if you please.
And your names are all on them.

396
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:46,656
Here you are Miss Rose. Oh, how nice.
Now would you help with the other presents?

397
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:49,757
- Here you are Miss Rose.
Oh, how nice. Now would you

398
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:51,960
help with the other presents?
- Oh how thoughtful Sara.

399
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:03,391
From one old trooper to another.
Me in younger and

400
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:06,880
happier days.
I was better known as Bobbling Bertie.

401
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:12,856
- Thank-you. We'd better keep this
present a secret. - Mums the word.

402
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:18,856
- Here this is from me. I hope you like it.
- It's just what I wanted.

403
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:21,656
Mums the word you know.

404
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,656
Here's my present Miss. Many
Happy Returns.

405
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:42,856
- Oh thank-you Becky.
- The material isn't new.

406
00:36:44,256 --> 00:36:49,856
- Why you dear Becky, you made it all
yourself. - Yes Miss. I made it at nights.

407
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:54,656
I knew you could pretend, I said,
with diamond pins stuck in.

408
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:58,420
- It's beautiful Becky,
I shall love it. Oh

409
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:01,680
will you Miss?
- The material isn't all new.

410
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:08,256
- And this isn't so very new either.
- It's my present to you.

411
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:12,056
- Yes Becky, with my love.
- What is it Miss?

412
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:16,456
It's a scarab from Egypt. My daddy
gave it to me, because it brings good luck.

413
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:20,256
I'd rather you had it, than anyone
else I know.

414
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:26,456
- Oh my Miss. I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh no Becky! Not now.

415
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:30,056
I have lots more presents for you.
Two in my room.

416
00:37:31,256 --> 00:37:34,856
- I don't know what to say Miss.
- You're sweet Becky.

417
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:37,856
Yes, yes, very nice.

418
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:41,319
- eg your pardon Miss. Yes?
Mr. Barrow of Barrow and

419
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:43,640
Skippo is here to see you.
- Today? I didn't send for him.

420
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:48,256
He seems very much upset about
something. He's waiting in your office.

421
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:52,456
- Miss Rose.
- The scarf is beautiful.

422
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:56,256
Miss Rose, remember to be sure
and tell me when it's almost 2 o'clock.

423
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:59,530
You know, I have a very
special appointment with my

424
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:02,280
daddy. He's going to be
thinking of me at exactly 2.

425
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,918
I'll watch the time.
Thank-you Miss Rose.

426
00:38:04,943 --> 00:38:08,280
Oh Sara! Thank-you for the
handkerchiefs, they're lovely.

427
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:12,456
- Don't you think it's time to
cut the cake? - Oh yes, the cake!

428
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,007
- Please be seated Mr. Barrow.
- How much did you

429
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:18,480
advance for this party?
Quite a sum, I suspect.

430
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:20,735
What does it matter.
Captain Crew is a very

431
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,680
wealthy man.
His check will be here shortly.

432
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:28,456
- No Miss Minchin. There'll be no check.
- What? What do you mean by that?

433
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:31,656
The late Captain Crew..... The
"late" Captain Crew?!

434
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:35,116
Captain Crew is dead.
He was so reported in the

435
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:37,880
list this morning.
Moreover, he died bankrupt

436
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:41,066
- Bankrupt?! But his property, his mines.
- His

437
00:38:41,091 --> 00:38:44,080
property and mines were
confiscated by the enemy.

438
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,139
You mean to tell me that
that child is penniless?

439
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:49,080
That she's left on my
hands with nothing?

440
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:52,656
She's certainly left penniless and
she's certainly left on your hands.

441
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:55,467
- She hasn't a relative
in the world that we know

442
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,480
of. - But her father's
account is overdrawn.

443
00:38:57,856 --> 00:39:02,656
I was expecting a check, and advanced the
money for this party. So I understand.

444
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:07,256
Now you have to make a wish and
blow out all the candles with one breath.

445
00:39:07,856 --> 00:39:11,256
My wish is that my father will come
back real soon.

446
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:14,456
Now take a big breath.

447
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:22,256
I haven't got very good lungs, have I?

448
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:24,794
- I'll turn her out on the
streets -Do you think that's

449
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:26,760
wise Miss Minchin.
The reputation of your school.

450
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:28,456
My school?

451
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:31,178
Well the report might get
about and it might not

452
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,280
sound well to the parents
of your other pupils.

453
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,456
Yes, that is so.

454
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,469
Of course, the child can
be made to serve in your

455
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:40,080
employ, until her
indebtedness is worked out.

456
00:39:40,256 --> 00:39:44,456
- But that will take years. - Quite so,
but at least it is better than nothing.

457
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:48,256
Hurry children, your ice-cream is melting.

458
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:53,056
- Tara, it's almost 2 o'clock darling.
- Thank-you Miss Rose.

459
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:19,856
Oh daddy, I'm thinking of you.

460
00:40:20,656 --> 00:40:26,656
And I know, wherever you are,
you're thinking of me too.

461
00:40:30,256 --> 00:40:34,056
Oh Miss Rose. I felt him with me,
I really did!

462
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:37,656
Miss Minchin wants you dear. Oh,
all right.

463
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,696
- Children, you will leave your gifts here.
- Why? Where are they going?

464
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:51,456
- Why can't they take the presents with
them? - Because they are not yours to give.

465
00:40:52,256 --> 00:40:56,056
- But I don't understand.
- You will later. Go to your room now.

466
00:40:56,456 --> 00:41:00,256
- But Miss Minchin.
- Sara, go to your room.

467
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:04,056
All of you.

468
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,627
Now will you tell her what it's all about?
What has happened Miss

469
00:41:09,651 --> 00:41:12,032
Minchin? Whatever it is,
you may want to let her off a bit easier.

470
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:17,256
Silence! Captain Crew is dead. His
name appeared on the list today.

471
00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:23,056
He left the child a pauper. Oh Miss
Minchin. You had better tell her.

472
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:28,456
- Oh, I couldn't do that.
- You will do as you are told.

473
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:48,256
Oh Miss Rose. What's wrong?
Why did Miss Minchin stop the party?

474
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:53,256
Sara, I want to talk to you dear.

475
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:01,856
- Oh darling........
- Oh Miss Rose! What is it?

476
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:06,856
Sara, you're a soldier's daughter.....

477
00:42:07,856 --> 00:42:10,707
and you know that
means being brave and

478
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:14,080
courageous, don't you?
No matter what happens.

479
00:42:14,656 --> 00:42:21,056
- Oh Miss Rose! Is it something awful?
- Your father.....

480
00:42:22,656 --> 00:42:27,456
But my father is all right. Mafeking
is set free. You heard them say so.

481
00:42:28,056 --> 00:42:31,533
Help didn't get there soon enough
dear, for him.

482
00:42:31,558 --> 00:42:34,680
His name appeared on
the list this morning.

483
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:39,656
- You mean with the wounded?
- No dear.

484
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:44,656
My daddy is...

485
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:51,056
Oh Sara, I'm so sorry.

486
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:58,656
It can't be! It isn't true! I won't
believe it! He isn't dead! He isn't!

487
00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:12,656
- Have you?
- Yes.

488
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:16,656
You may go.

489
00:43:25,256 --> 00:43:32,056
You may go.

490
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,856
Come with me.

491
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,056
This is to be your room in the future.

492
00:44:27,856 --> 00:44:30,379
I shall have to sell your
furnishings and clothes,

493
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,480
to pay part of the
debt your father owes.

494
00:44:32,856 --> 00:44:35,441
Ordinarily,
you would go to a charitable

495
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:38,680
institution,
but I'm going to let you remain here.

496
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:42,056
There will be duties for you to
perform, of course.

497
00:44:42,856 --> 00:44:46,856
I hope you appreciate my kindness
in not sending you away.

498
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:54,002
I was unable to fi nd a
black dress among your

499
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,680
things, but one of the
girls has given you this.

500
00:44:57,256 --> 00:45:00,656
You'd better take off that party frock
and put this on.

501
00:45:01,656 --> 00:45:04,256
I'll send up some shoes.

502
00:45:33,056 --> 00:45:37,456
I don't believe it. I don't, I don't!

503
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:48,256
My daddy has to go away. But he'll
return most any day.

504
00:45:49,256 --> 00:45:53,856
Any moment I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

505
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,656
And Miss Minchin is going to sell all
her things.

506
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:06,283
It was beastly having to
give back all our presents.

507
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:09,080
How do you feel now
about your little Princess?

508
00:46:14,256 --> 00:46:20,856
- Oh Miss. Is there anything I can do?
- No Becky, but thank-you.

509
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,256
Sara, I'm sorry.

510
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:40,398
Sara, from now on,
you are not to sit with us.

511
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:43,280
Return to your room and
smooth down those curls.

512
00:46:43,656 --> 00:46:47,656
And then go to the kitchen. Run
along now.

513
00:46:51,656 --> 00:46:55,256
Lavina, you may take your old
place, beside me.

514
00:47:07,056 --> 00:47:10,856
- Mrs. O'Connel. - Oh, so the Misses
has sent you down to me, has she?

515
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:14,437
- Miss Minchin said that I am to
have my breakfast here. - You'll

516
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:17,080
do more than eat your breakfast
if you work for that one.

517
00:47:17,656 --> 00:47:21,056
- I should be glad to help.
- You will eh?

518
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:26,656
Look at you! Look what you're
doing! For that you'll get no breakfast.

519
00:47:27,256 --> 00:47:30,256
Min, you'd better make some more
toast for the Misses. Right.

520
00:47:31,656 --> 00:47:36,256
Here's your breakfast. Take it over
there. We don't associate with royality.

521
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,285
- Let me wait on you Miss. No you don't.
- She can

522
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,880
wait on herself.
You can sit there and watch her eat.

523
00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:45,856
Perhaps that will teach you a leson.

524
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:54,003
Please Mrs. O'Connel.
May I give my breakfast

525
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:56,080
to Becky?
I'm not that hungry this morning.

526
00:47:56,656 --> 00:48:00,256
Give it to the cat if you like. Then
get to work and wash them dishes.

527
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:08,456
No Miss, I don't want it.

528
00:48:24,056 --> 00:48:26,256
The mail just came.

529
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:37,456
The mail just came.

530
00:48:53,456 --> 00:48:56,432
My darling girl.
I have been half mad trying to

531
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:59,680
find a way out of you since
your letter reached me.

532
00:49:00,056 --> 00:49:03,456
But it has come! My grandfather
has relented.

533
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:07,728
I pray him,
that this money and my love will

534
00:49:07,753 --> 00:49:11,280
help you bear what lies ahead.
Geoffrey.

535
00:49:12,056 --> 00:49:15,054
You say this girl's a
teacher at your school?

536
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:17,880
She was,
until I discharged her today.

537
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:20,856
We're not likely to hear from her again.

538
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:25,656
And I was prepared to turn over a
handsome sum to that boy when he got back.

539
00:49:26,056 --> 00:49:29,456
I even made an ass of myself and
sent him a check.

540
00:49:29,856 --> 00:49:34,456
Then I was right to withhold this.
He made it over to her.

541
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:40,256
- You're not very fond of the girl,
are you? - Hardly, under the circumstances.

542
00:49:41,656 --> 00:49:44,712
- Are you sure the girl
has no legitimate claims

543
00:49:44,737 --> 00:49:47,480
on him?
- I brought her up from a fondling.

544
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:52,656
Is it likely, she would not have consulted
me if their love had been respectable.

545
00:49:55,856 --> 00:49:58,056
Ram Dass!

546
00:50:00,656 --> 00:50:03,538
Yes sir? In future if any
letters or cables come

547
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:06,680
from Mr. Geoffrey,
they're to be returned, unopened.

548
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:09,456
As you wish sahib.

549
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,456
Come in Becky.

550
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:34,856
I'm glad you weren't asleep Miss.
It's one of the lonely nights.

551
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:39,656
I wonder where Miss Rose is?
I shall miss her terribly.

552
00:50:40,656 --> 00:50:43,619
We're all alone in the world
now, aren't we Miss?

553
00:50:43,644 --> 00:50:47,080
No, no, we're not alone.
There is my father you know.

554
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:51,164
- Your father? But cook said he......
- You

555
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:54,880
mustn't say that.
It isn't true. He's not dead.

556
00:50:55,256 --> 00:50:58,856
He sick or wounded somewhere, or
he'd send for me. But he's not dead.

557
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:04,056
- How do you know Miss?
- Something inside tells me so.

558
00:51:04,456 --> 00:51:07,456
And sometimes I hear him calling for me.

559
00:51:08,856 --> 00:51:10,856
All alone Miss.

560
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:24,056
- Buford! You're smoking!
- As you see.

561
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,930
- Today my good woman,
the British army is behind

562
00:51:27,955 --> 00:51:31,080
me. - That uniform?
You're not going to war.

563
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:34,209
Quite! To the very cannon's
mouth, if need be. But why?

564
00:51:34,234 --> 00:51:37,280
Because old girl. I've had it
to the teeth with your bulling.

565
00:51:37,656 --> 00:51:40,435
And your treatment of Rose and
little Sara is the last straw.

566
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,880
I prefer the less painful
horrors of the battlefield.

567
00:51:43,256 --> 00:51:46,456
- Are you daring to critize me?
- Astonishing, isn't it?

568
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:50,856
But it proves that I am competent to
lead my men, into the very jaws of death.

569
00:51:51,456 --> 00:51:55,256
- After this, you may never expect
help from me again. - I am quite calm.

570
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:58,498
For if the blood-thirsty
boar spares me, the

571
00:51:58,523 --> 00:52:01,680
foot-knights will see
Bubbling Bertie once again.

572
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:07,456
- Buford, you wouldn't do that to me?
Oh wouldn't I? - Well, ta-ta old girl.

573
00:52:43,856 --> 00:52:47,256
If you please sir? What is it lassie?
Were you at the seige of Mafeking?

574
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:50,344
- Aye, that's where I
stopped the bullet that

575
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,880
stopped me.
- Then did you know my father?

576
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:56,656
- Your father? What might his
name be lassie? - Captain I Crew.

577
00:52:57,056 --> 00:53:01,456
- Was your father a Captain? - Yes. They
say he is dead, but I know it can't be.

578
00:53:01,856 --> 00:53:04,697
- I've asked so many
soldiers about him. I hope

579
00:53:04,722 --> 00:53:07,680
you can tell me.
- No lassie, I'm sorry, I can't.

580
00:53:08,056 --> 00:53:10,509
- Why don't you ask in the hospital there?
- Maybe

581
00:53:10,534 --> 00:53:13,280
they'll have some record of him.
Thank-you sir, I will!

582
00:53:19,256 --> 00:53:23,856
- If you please sir.
- Well the little Princess as I live.

583
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:27,856
Why Mr. Bertie, I thought you'd
gone to war

584
00:53:28,256 --> 00:53:30,809
No, Lord Roberts wanted
me to of course. But he

585
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:33,280
said: "Bertie old boy,
the wounded need you."

586
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:38,056
So you stay here and cheer up the brave
lads who have fallen in our dust corps."

587
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:41,456
So I'm practically in command of
this hospital.

588
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:46,856
- Oh Mr. Bertie. Can my father be in there?
- Your father Princess?

589
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:51,456
Yes, you see I know he isn't dead.
I've been looking and looking.

590
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:57,456
He could be among the wounded, couldn't he?
Yes..... I'm almost sure he is, somewhere.

591
00:53:58,056 --> 00:54:02,656
If you're in charge, could I please look
for him in there? Well ah..... Pleeeeeease.

592
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:06,856
Yes, yes of course you may. Things
like that can happen you know.

593
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:25,551
Mr. Bertie,
why did you join the command here?

594
00:54:25,576 --> 00:54:29,080
Well disipline in the
hospital is rather lax.

595
00:54:29,656 --> 00:54:34,456
I say Major. They're waiting for you in
ward B. There is a lot of trash up there.

596
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:39,656
- Very good. I'll get one of my men to
attend to it. - Get one of your what??

597
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:42,456
Well then 2 of my men, carry on!

598
00:54:47,456 --> 00:54:49,656
Portor! Sir?

599
00:54:50,856 --> 00:54:54,102
- What's this child doing here before
visiting hours? - Well you see... Well,

600
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:57,080
well, well. If you please sir.
The Major is helping me find my father.

601
00:54:58,056 --> 00:55:01,856
- The Major? - For her sir. You
see, we're old friends sir.

602
00:55:02,256 --> 00:55:05,856
I knew her father, Captin Crew was
reported killed at Mafeking.

603
00:55:06,256 --> 00:55:09,656
The child is sure there is some mistake, so
I'm helping her search among the wounded.

604
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:16,256
- Could you tell me anything about my
father sir? - Sorry my dear, I can't.

605
00:55:17,656 --> 00:55:21,456
- Carry on, Major!
- Yes, sir. Thank-you sir.

606
00:55:37,256 --> 00:55:39,556
This little girl's father
has been killed, but she

607
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:41,880
insists he's alive so I'm
letting her look around.

608
00:55:52,856 --> 00:55:55,256
We'll try another ward.

609
00:56:08,256 --> 00:56:11,456
- There's old Bertie.
- Give us a song mate.

610
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:16,256
Attention men! Attention! Official
inspection.

611
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:23,856
He isn't here either. But someone
might know about him.

612
00:56:26,256 --> 00:56:29,030
If you please sir.
Were you at the seige of Mafeking?

613
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:31,880
I was that darling.
It's there I got bit by a bug.

614
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:35,104
It was no bigger than the seed
of a thistle and it laid me

615
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:37,880
low. Ah, the bugs down there
are worse than the bullets.

616
00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:41,156
- Perhaps you didn't know my father?
- Afraid I wouldn't

617
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:44,080
have known me own father,
with the fever that was on me.

618
00:56:44,656 --> 00:56:47,456
- Thank-you sir.
- It's all right darling.

619
00:56:58,856 --> 00:57:02,245
If you please sir.
Were you with the troops at Mafeking?

620
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,480
Yes, yes of course I was.
That's where I ran away.

621
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:11,056
- Then did you know my father,
Captain Crew? - Yes, yes of course.

622
00:57:11,656 --> 00:57:14,628
That's a fine looking officer, isn't he?
He ought to do well.

623
00:57:14,653 --> 00:57:17,480
Well when did you see my father last?
Where is he now?

624
00:57:18,256 --> 00:57:20,432
Where is who? My father.
Oh, one soldier more

625
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:22,680
or less, doesn't make
any difference you know.

626
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:26,519
I'm making thousands and
thousands for England. Fine

627
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:29,680
strong fellows,
who won't be afraid like I was.

628
00:57:30,056 --> 00:57:33,856
I was afraid of the noise. That's
why I ran away you know?

629
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:43,229
- He says he knows my father,
but he won't tell. - He's been

630
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:46,080
living in a dream Sara,
he doesn't know what he's saying.

631
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,656
Don't go yet lad. Give us a song!

632
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:54,328
- How about it dear?
Shall we sing them a song to cheer

633
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:56,880
them up?
- Our old speciality. Not today Mr. Bertie.

634
00:57:57,256 --> 00:58:00,100
- Oh come on darling.
Let's try and forget our own troubles and

635
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:02,880
do something for these lads, shall we?
- All right, I'll try.

636
00:58:03,456 --> 00:58:05,675
- What about "The Old Kent Road"?
Yeah, that's the one.

637
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,680
Mackie will play for you.
- I'd be delighted Mac.

638
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,113
- Mr. Bertie, will it be all right
if I come again tomorrow? - I

639
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:26,080
shouldn't run away too often Princess.
You might get punished you know.

640
00:59:26,456 --> 00:59:29,105
- I'll keep a sharp look-out
for whenever the wounded

641
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,680
come in. -You don't really
believe he come, do you?

642
00:59:32,056 --> 00:59:36,056
Yes, yes, of course I do. I told you
missing men often turn up.

643
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:40,256
Then I'd better come. You might
not know him, if he's very much changed.

644
00:59:40,856 --> 00:59:44,856
- All right dear. You come.
- Good-bye Mr. Bertie. Good-bye dear.

645
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,456
Are you hungry.

646
00:59:56,856 --> 01:00:00,256
Poor little things. There won't be
any worms for you this morning.

647
01:00:03,856 --> 01:00:06,370
Good-morning little misses sahib.
Good morning

648
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,480
Ras Dass.
Feeding your little friends?

649
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:11,779
- Yes, but I couldn't feed
them very much from my supper

650
01:00:11,804 --> 01:00:14,880
last night. - It is difficult
for them when the snow comes.

651
01:00:18,056 --> 01:00:20,056
Rani, Rani!

652
01:00:22,256 --> 01:00:25,856
You look as though you are being
naughty and enjoying it.

653
01:00:28,056 --> 01:00:31,056
- Her she is, on the bookshelf.
- Bookshelf?

654
01:00:31,656 --> 01:00:35,656
Oh I forgot. I pretend it's a bookshelf
and fill them with beautiful books.

655
01:00:36,056 --> 01:00:40,056
Well I'd better remove her, before
she ruins your set of Dickens.

656
01:00:48,256 --> 01:00:50,722
This is your room Misses sahib?
It's so old and so high

657
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:53,080
above everything,
it's almost like a nest in a tree.

658
01:00:53,656 --> 01:00:56,238
I can lie on my soft
sofa and look up into the

659
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,680
sky through that little
window on the roof.

660
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:03,456
- Sofa? - It looks more like a
soft sofa when it's made up.

661
01:01:03,856 --> 01:01:08,656
Can you imagine it has down quilts
and lovely cushions to curl up on.

662
01:01:11,456 --> 01:01:15,043
- There is a fire sometimes, of course?
- Well,

663
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:18,280
that is the hardest
sometimes, to imagine.

664
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:21,969
But it's lovely when you can.
The grate shines so when

665
01:01:21,994 --> 01:01:24,880
it is polished and the
bright coals on the hearth.

666
01:01:26,656 --> 01:01:29,246
Oh hurry Miss.
Cook is in an awful dither.

667
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:31,680
Oh my goodness.
Excuse me if I run.

668
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:35,656
I've got to go to the butcher. I'll get
my ears boxed if I don't hurry.

669
01:01:51,656 --> 01:01:57,656
Listen to this: Hospital Ship Mercy
arrived with 1 200 wounded disembarked.

670
01:01:58,056 --> 01:02:00,656
- Does it give any of the names?
- There ain't no list.

671
01:02:01,256 --> 01:02:04,293
Oh I hope my poor Harry's among them.
A wounded

672
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:07,480
husband is better than no
husband at all, eh Min?

673
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:12,899
Oh Becky,
I've got to get to the hospital

674
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:15,880
before 9 o'clock when
they close for visitors.

675
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:24,856
Sara! You clumsy ox! For that
you'll whistle for your supper.

676
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:27,650
Oh Mame, Sara didn't get know lunch.
You put

677
01:02:27,675 --> 01:02:30,280
things away before she
got back from the grocer.

678
01:02:30,656 --> 01:02:33,735
Who do you think you're talking to?
You'll both go

679
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,080
hungry. Now clean up this mess.
Go on, get on with it!

680
01:02:41,856 --> 01:02:44,656
There some sorry cases in this
batch, doctor.

681
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,330
Doctor, this man is an unknown.
His papers were lost.

682
01:02:50,355 --> 01:02:52,680
Delerium following maleria fever.

683
01:02:53,056 --> 01:02:55,387
- We're very much concerned about him sir.
- Heart

684
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:57,880
action, weak resperation,
well that's to be expected.

685
01:02:58,256 --> 01:03:01,727
- He has no lucid moments.
- Temporary paralyzes

686
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:05,080
of some nerve center or
a blood clot possibly.

687
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:08,656
More likely to be the latter sir.
He received a nasty headwound.

688
01:03:11,256 --> 01:03:15,056
- He repeated the call of this person Sara.
- You can't know who this Sara is?

689
01:03:15,456 --> 01:03:19,456
No way of finding out sir, until his
identity is established.

690
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:36,384
- You'd better go now Miss.
- I'll finish up

691
01:03:36,409 --> 01:03:38,880
for you. Thank-you Becky.
I'll have to fly.

692
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:47,016
Here hold your horses.
Where do you think you're going?

693
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:50,280
Miss Lavina want's some coal
for her fire. Hop to it.

694
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:56,856
Oh Sara! You look so tired and you
look hungry too.

695
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:06,456
- Are you actually hungry Sara? - Yes!
I am hungry. I'm so hungry I could eat you!

696
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:22,856
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.

697
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:33,056
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.

698
01:04:34,256 --> 01:04:36,856
Come back here and clean up that hearth!

699
01:04:46,256 --> 01:04:50,056
I'd like my shawl. The pink one. It's
on my bed.

700
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:56,456
Cover me please. I find the room a
bit chilly.

701
01:05:43,456 --> 01:05:45,358
Hello Princess,
what are you doing out so late?

702
01:05:45,383 --> 01:05:47,680
I've come to see the new
soldiers that arrived today.

703
01:05:48,056 --> 01:05:53,656
- Not tonight my girl. It's closing time.
- But I've got to. I ran away especially.

704
01:05:54,256 --> 01:05:58,256
- Please let me in. I'm sure he's here this
time. - You're sure every time Princess.

705
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:02,075
I'm sorry. You run on home and
come back tomorrow morning.

706
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,680
That's a good little girl.
All right, good-night now.

707
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,906
He'll recover from the
effects of the fever,

708
01:06:31,931 --> 01:06:34,080
but I'm convinced there
is brain pressure.

709
01:06:34,456 --> 01:06:37,156
You advise an operation then?
Yes. Do you agree.

710
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,880
I do and Dr. McNesh
in Edinburgh is the man.

711
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:43,856
Prepare this man for removal to
Edinburgh tomorrow. Yes doctor.

712
01:07:05,256 --> 01:07:09,256
Sara, where have you been?

713
01:07:10,456 --> 01:07:13,856
- Answer me. You've been out, haven't you?
- Yes Miss Minchin.

714
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:18,456
- What do you mean by disobeying my orders?
- I had to, I had to look for my father.

715
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:21,803
All this ridiculous searching
for your father. All this

716
01:07:21,828 --> 01:07:24,880
making believe and refusing to face
facts, it's indecent.

717
01:07:25,256 --> 01:07:28,262
- I've had enough of it.
You must realize once and for all that

718
01:07:28,287 --> 01:07:31,480
your father is dead. - Don't you
say that. He's not dead. He's not!

719
01:07:31,856 --> 01:07:34,595
- And you can't stop me from
looking for him either. - How

720
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,080
dare you speak to me in
that manner you little......

721
01:07:42,256 --> 01:07:45,256
I'll attend to you further in the morning.

722
01:07:51,856 --> 01:07:56,656
I can't be a good soldier for much
longer. I'm cold and I'm hungry too.

723
01:07:57,056 --> 01:08:00,757
Do you hear?
No, you don't hear and you don't

724
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:04,080
care. You're nothing but a
doll, a doll!

725
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:08,256
You've never had a heart to make
you feel. You're just a doll.

726
01:10:06,856 --> 01:10:10,056
Your Highness, please forgive me,
but something has gone amiss.

727
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:14,056
There is an angry woman outside to
report a stolen kiss.

728
01:10:15,456 --> 01:10:19,056
Tell her she must go away. Come
around some other day.

729
01:10:19,456 --> 01:10:21,718
I have told her but she won't.
You must see her,

730
01:10:21,743 --> 01:10:23,680
if you don't,
she'll scream her head off.

731
01:10:24,056 --> 01:10:26,072
- Tell her to hush. She won't be hushed.
- Then

732
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,280
tell her to shush!
I'm afraid she won't be shushed.

733
01:10:29,856 --> 01:10:35,456
I won't be hushed, I won't be shushed, I
know my rights and I know also what I saw.

734
01:10:36,056 --> 01:10:38,056
- What did you see?
- I saw him.

735
01:10:38,456 --> 01:10:40,456
You saw who? I mean whom?

736
01:10:40,856 --> 01:10:45,056
I saw that lad steal a kiss, from that
shameless little miss.

737
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:49,856
Don't be fooled by all their shyness,
they're a wicked pair Your Highness.

738
01:10:50,256 --> 01:10:53,856
The Law says in its shining,
that you should not kiss in this land.

739
01:10:54,456 --> 01:10:58,856
There's a law I understand, against
kissing in this land.

740
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:02,656
There is a law that reads like this.
No one is to steal a kiss.

741
01:11:03,056 --> 01:11:07,656
Ah but Princess, I've a feeling, this
isn't a case of stealing.

742
01:11:07,856 --> 01:11:10,456
Silence fool. I know the law. What
I say I saw, I saw.

743
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:15,256
She's on a see-saw. What I saw,
you saw, he saw, she saw.

744
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:19,856
On a see-saw. On a see-saw. l
saw, you saw, he saw, she saw.

745
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:24,256
What she tells us may be true. And
if it is, what can we do?

746
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:28,256
If you ask me, we should listen, to
the lad who did the kissing.

747
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:33,456
Let him speak. Come lad this way.
Now then, what have you to say?

748
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:39,456
Please Your Highness, I confess.
When I saw such lovliness...

749
01:11:39,856 --> 01:11:44,456
it was too much to resist. I just
thought she should be kisssed.

750
01:11:45,056 --> 01:11:49,656
So I kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.

751
01:11:50,256 --> 01:11:54,456
So he kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.

752
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:58,656
There you see, he broke the law.
What I say I saw, I saw.

753
01:11:59,056 --> 01:12:02,856
- Please don't start all that again.
- But he stole a kiss, that's plain.

754
01:12:05,056 --> 01:12:09,656
Yes, it looks as if it's true and I'll
have to punish you.

755
01:12:13,256 --> 01:12:18,456
No please. Let me say a word. It is
not the way you heard.

756
01:12:20,056 --> 01:12:25,856
Please, he did not steal a kiss.
I gave it to him. Just like this.

757
01:12:31,256 --> 01:12:34,456
There you see, I had a feeling, this
was not a case of stealing.

758
01:12:35,056 --> 01:12:40,056
I'm not sure, it's not quite plain,
could I see that kiss again?

759
01:12:44,256 --> 01:12:48,456
You were right, I have a feeling, this
was not a case of stealing.

760
01:12:48,856 --> 01:12:53,056
Right! The law has been abused.
This lad has falsely been accused.

761
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:57,256
He's hers and she's hisn's, that old
witch should go to prison.

762
01:12:57,656 --> 01:13:02,456
- You're a very wicked woman.
- Princess, I am only human.

763
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:07,656
Listen to the old grand-mommy.
You're a nasty peeping-tommy.

764
01:13:08,256 --> 01:13:12,256
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.

765
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:16,456
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.

766
01:13:16,856 --> 01:13:20,656
But what I say I saw, I saw. I know
my rights, I know the law!

767
01:13:23,856 --> 01:13:29,056
Come and sit beside me here. Your
kiss has made things very clear.

768
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,256
Thank-you Princess.

769
01:13:31,656 --> 01:13:35,856
Don't thank me. Was that kiss, that
set you free.

770
01:13:39,656 --> 01:13:43,256
Now we're through with this arrangement.
Let us have some entertainment.

771
01:13:43,656 --> 01:13:47,656
Bring the dancers, bring the singers,
bring the good old welting ringers.

772
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:51,991
- The new ballerina? She please you?
- She's

773
01:14:52,016 --> 01:14:55,080
a very good dancer.
She looks familiar too.

774
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:31,456
What a nice dream. I feel quite warm.

775
01:15:34,456 --> 01:15:37,056
I don't want to wake up.

776
01:15:49,056 --> 01:15:51,256
I haven't waked up.

777
01:16:10,656 --> 01:16:12,656
I must be dreaming.

778
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,856
I am dreaming.

779
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:26,856
I must be dreaming. But it feels
warm.

780
01:16:27,856 --> 01:16:30,656
Becky, Becky come quick.

781
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:37,056
- Yes Miss?
- Look!

782
01:16:38,456 --> 01:16:41,856
Oh no Miss. Do you see what I do?

783
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:47,656
- I don't know what you see. - But I don't
believe what I see. Well, I never.....

784
01:16:48,056 --> 01:16:53,256
- Can you feel that? Yes Miss.
- What do you see? I see some fire Miss.

785
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:57,856
And a table with food on it, and a
rug and a lamp, and slippers?

786
01:16:58,456 --> 01:17:03,856
I do indeed Miss. How did it all get
here? Did you pretend it into happening?

787
01:17:04,256 --> 01:17:08,456
I don't know. I never pretended as
good as this before.

788
01:17:09,256 --> 01:17:11,056
Look at these.

789
01:17:15,656 --> 01:17:18,334
- If the little misses sahib
knew, she'd be

790
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:21,280
over here to thank you.
- Who wants any thanks?

791
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:28,656
- Oh Miss! You're beautiful! - Thanks
Becky. Now let's try this one on you.

792
01:17:32,456 --> 01:17:37,456
- Isn't it beautiful? Oh yes Miss.
- It's perfect. And real satin too.

793
01:17:38,056 --> 01:17:40,856
Let's try the slippers and see if
they're real.

794
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:45,856
- Do they feel like slippers to you?
- They feel soft and warm.

795
01:17:46,256 --> 01:17:50,656
This feels soft and warm too.
They're as real as we are.

796
01:17:51,056 --> 01:17:53,856
I don't believe it's a dream after all.

797
01:17:55,056 --> 01:17:59,056
- Do you suppose the food is real Miss?
- Let us see.

798
01:18:02,856 --> 01:18:06,656
- I can smell kippers, can you?
- Kippers and onions.

799
01:18:08,256 --> 01:18:11,056
I wonder what this is? Muffins!

800
01:18:12,256 --> 01:18:15,256
This tastes like a muffin. Is it one?

801
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:20,456
A muffin that ever was. It must be
the magic Miss.

802
01:18:20,856 --> 01:18:23,856
Hadn't we better be quick before it
melts away?

803
01:18:27,456 --> 01:18:30,256
- What sort of night did he have?
- He rested comfortably doctor.

804
01:18:30,656 --> 01:18:32,418
Will we be able to
send him with the others?

805
01:18:32,443 --> 01:18:34,360
Will we be able to
send him with the others?

806
01:18:34,656 --> 01:18:38,856
Get him ready to be sent with group
D. He'll be leaving in about an hour.

807
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:58,256
I hear you're being punished. Do you
think we ought to offer her a chocolate?

808
01:18:58,656 --> 01:19:02,656
- You must let her smell them. - Miss
Minchin surely couldn't object to that.

809
01:19:03,056 --> 01:19:07,656
- Would you care to? - I don't want to
smell them, and I don't want to eat them.

810
01:19:08,256 --> 01:19:12,656
- You don't!? Why not? - I've had much
nicer things than chocolate this morning.

811
01:19:13,856 --> 01:19:17,656
- Listen to the Princess, pretending again.
- I'm not pretending.

812
01:19:18,056 --> 01:19:21,056
I had the most wonderful things to
eat, that anyone had.

813
01:19:22,256 --> 01:19:27,056
- Why you little liar. You haven't even had
breakfast. - Pardon me, but I really have.

814
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:31,256
Excuse me for saying so, it isn't
polite to call people liars.

815
01:19:31,856 --> 01:19:37,656
- How dare you talk back to me.
- Was I doing that? My goodness.

816
01:19:39,656 --> 01:19:41,856
So sorry.

817
01:19:43,656 --> 01:19:46,056
You wait til I tell Miss Minchin on you!

818
01:19:52,056 --> 01:19:54,456
Well, everything is still here Becky.

819
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:58,456
- Thank heavens it's stopped raining.
- Are you going some place Miss?

820
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:02,856
To the hospital. Becky, perhaps
everything is going to change for us.

821
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:06,856
Perhaps I'll find my father this time
and he'll take us away from here.

822
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:11,256
Oh no! It's the Misses.

823
01:20:13,256 --> 01:20:15,256
Sara, how dare you......

824
01:20:16,656 --> 01:20:20,456
- Why, what's happened to this room?
- That's what we would like to know.

825
01:20:20,856 --> 01:20:23,449
When I woke up this morning,
here everything was.

826
01:20:23,474 --> 01:20:25,080
Even to the food and the fire.

827
01:20:25,456 --> 01:20:28,856
- Where did you get these things?
- I don't know. Maybe because

828
01:20:28,881 --> 01:20:32,280
I dreamed such a beautiful dream
last night, that it came true.

829
01:20:32,856 --> 01:20:36,456
These articles are rare and costly.
You stole them, didn't you?

830
01:20:36,856 --> 01:20:38,909
Oh no Miss Minchin.
We didn't take these things.

831
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,280
I'll give you one more
chance to tell me the truth.

832
01:20:41,656 --> 01:20:46,256
- But I am telling you the truth. - They
just came. Yes, they did indeed Mame.

833
01:20:46,656 --> 01:20:50,056
You go to your room. This is a
matter for the police.

834
01:20:50,656 --> 01:20:53,936
- Oh please Miss Minchin. Please don't call
the police. - Of course I'll call them.

835
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,791
- Oh we're prisoners sure enough
Miss, and the

836
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,080
police coming too.
- I can't be arrested.

837
01:21:09,456 --> 01:21:12,397
- Those new wounded men
are at the hospital and I

838
01:21:12,422 --> 01:21:15,480
got to get to them.
- I don't see how you can Miss.

839
01:21:15,856 --> 01:21:19,456
Come on Becky, quick. Where are
we going Miss? Follow me.

840
01:21:21,656 --> 01:21:23,925
- Oh I'm so frightened Miss.
I'm frightened this

841
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:26,080
time too.
- Come on Becky, give me your hand.

842
01:21:30,456 --> 01:21:34,056
- Oh low Miss.
- Don't be afraid Becky.

843
01:21:43,656 --> 01:21:46,401
- Ah, what game is this little
Misses sihib? - Can we please

844
01:21:46,426 --> 01:21:49,080
go through your house?
We're running away from the police.

845
01:21:49,456 --> 01:21:54,056
- And a very nice game to. Would you enter?
- We would like to, very much indeed.

846
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:05,197
- You seem in great haste Miss sihib.
Will you not stop for a

847
01:22:05,222 --> 01:22:07,680
cup of tea? - Oh no thank you.
We're in too big of a hurry.

848
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,856
Oh, I see. You are still playing the
game of the police.

849
01:22:11,456 --> 01:22:15,256
- I hope you escape in safety Miss sihib.
- So do I. Oh low Miss, police!!

850
01:22:16,256 --> 01:22:20,456
- There they are! Stop them!
- Becky, run, run!

851
01:22:22,456 --> 01:22:25,656
Sara, Becky! Stop where you are!

852
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:30,656
Go after the other one. I'll take care
of her.

853
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:35,456
Watch out Becky, don't slip. Becky,
where are you?

854
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:56,695
Wretched little beast.
You'll go to jail, both of you!

855
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,080
You'll never catch Sara.
Mr. Bertie will see to that.

856
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,320
So that's where she's gone.
Well did you find them Mame? Take this

857
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:05,080
little thief and don't let her
out of your sight till I return.

858
01:23:06,056 --> 01:23:08,197
- Did you catch her?
She dodged her way into traffic. - I

859
01:23:08,221 --> 01:23:10,632
couldn't find her anywhere.
Do you know where she's likely to be?

860
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:12,656
I do. Cabbie!

861
01:23:19,456 --> 01:23:21,856
Harvard Hospital and hurry please.

862
01:23:28,456 --> 01:23:31,256
He never stops calling for her.

863
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:51,256
Step aside a little bit will you? Ah,
ah, ah. You can't go in there.

864
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:55,456
- No visitors allowed for an hour.
- But that might be too late.

865
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:59,256
Now run along little girl, will you?

866
01:24:02,256 --> 01:24:06,256
- I'm sorry sir. No visitors allowed
for an hour. - But we must go in.

867
01:24:06,856 --> 01:24:09,656
Sorry sir. You can stand over there,
if that's all right.

868
01:24:19,256 --> 01:24:22,856
- Have you seen Captain Marks? - I believe
he just went through the hall Miss.

869
01:24:23,256 --> 01:24:25,976
- Sorry young one, but you can't
go upstairs now. - But I've got to.

870
01:24:26,001 --> 01:24:28,720
I've got to see if my father is
here before Miss Minchin catches me.

871
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,656
Run along now. Do as you are told.

872
01:24:33,656 --> 01:24:36,856
I say there. You come back here.
You can't go up there.

873
01:24:39,256 --> 01:24:42,056
You can't go in there.

874
01:24:42,456 --> 01:24:46,056
Let me go, let me go. I want to be
here. I will! I will!

875
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,056
Porter!!

876
01:24:51,056 --> 01:24:53,656
What is it the child wants?

877
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:58,856
- Please, please don't let them
take me away. - What is it child?

878
01:24:59,256 --> 01:25:03,456
My father. They say he was killed
at Mafeking, but I don't believe it.

879
01:25:03,856 --> 01:25:07,456
He may be with the new wounded
men, but they won't let me look.

880
01:25:07,856 --> 01:25:10,526
If they don't,
perhaps I'll never have another

881
01:25:10,551 --> 01:25:12,880
chance.
Can't you make them let me look.

882
01:25:14,256 --> 01:25:19,456
Colonel. Could you see that this
child is escorted through the hospital?

883
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:24,656
With permission, I shall accompany
her personally Your Majesty.

884
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:32,856
- What is your name?
- Victoria. What is yours?

885
01:25:34,656 --> 01:25:38,456
Sara.......Oh Your Majesty!

886
01:25:44,256 --> 01:25:46,056
Colonel.

887
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:54,056
I hope that you will fi nd your father
my dear. A thorough search Colonel.

888
01:25:55,256 --> 01:25:59,856
- Oh thank-you Your Majesty.
- Good-bye my dear.

889
01:26:10,656 --> 01:26:14,056
- Have you been through any of
the wards yet? - Not today sir.

890
01:26:14,456 --> 01:26:17,256
I think we'd better cover this wing first.

891
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:32,856
We are searching for a patient.
Move right along dear.

892
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:39,656
- Is it all right?
- Thank-you darling.

893
01:26:47,456 --> 01:26:51,456
- Miss Rose!
- Sara darling!

894
01:26:52,456 --> 01:26:57,456
Oh Mr. Geoffrey. You're home, you're back
again. You can tell me where my daddy is.

895
01:26:58,056 --> 01:27:00,856
Well Geoffrey didn't get as far as
Mafeking dear.

896
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:05,856
Then you don't know? You didn't
even see him?

897
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:12,256
No dear, I didn't. I'm sorry.

898
01:27:14,656 --> 01:27:17,256
- Have you found him?
- Oh, no sir.

899
01:27:17,656 --> 01:27:22,056
This is my friend Mr. Geoffrey and
his wife. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.

900
01:27:22,656 --> 01:27:24,717
- Mrs. Hamilton.
- I'm afraid I can't introduce you,

901
01:27:24,742 --> 01:27:26,840
because I don't know your name.
- I'm Colonel Gordon.

902
01:27:27,056 --> 01:27:29,342
- This is Colonel Gordan.
He's helping me search the

903
01:27:29,367 --> 01:27:31,480
hospital.
- Oh, don't bother. How do you do sir?

904
01:27:31,856 --> 01:27:35,056
I'm very happy to know you both.
From Mafeking?

905
01:27:35,456 --> 01:27:41,656
- No sir. An army mule, a British mule at
that. - That's adding insult to injury.

906
01:27:42,256 --> 01:27:46,456
- Sorry sir, but it's time for the patient's
drops. - Well, I'd rather face that mule.

907
01:27:47,056 --> 01:27:50,856
I'll come back later Miss Rose. Just as
soon as I've gone through the other wards.

908
01:27:51,256 --> 01:27:54,656
- I'll wait for you dear.
- Good-bye.

909
01:27:55,656 --> 01:27:58,256
- Be sure to come back Sara.
- I will.

910
01:28:02,256 --> 01:28:05,856
Poor little thing. She'll never stop
hoping.

911
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,584
- I insist that you send for my brother.
- Very well

912
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:12,480
Mame, but you can't get in.
Brother or no brother.

913
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:18,656
- We will get in. My brother will see
to that. - I hope you're right Mame.

914
01:28:29,056 --> 01:28:32,856
All filled now. This man will have to
wait until the next ambulance.

915
01:28:33,456 --> 01:28:36,291
I think you'd better take
him into the waiting room.

916
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:38,080
These halls are much too drafty.

917
01:28:45,456 --> 01:28:49,056
- I very sorry that you couldn't find your
father. - Thank-you just the same sir.

918
01:28:49,456 --> 01:28:51,202
He may be on the next
convoy of wounded.

919
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:53,280
I wouldn't give up hope.
I won't sir.

920
01:28:53,656 --> 01:28:56,456
- Good-bye and God bless.
- Good-bye.

921
01:28:59,256 --> 01:29:01,656
I know that they were stolen.
That is perposterous!

922
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:04,680
I can prove it and I intend to
turn her over to the authorities.

923
01:29:05,056 --> 01:29:07,897
She is in this hospital
and I intend to find her.

924
01:29:07,922 --> 01:29:10,080
I insist that every
room be searched.

925
01:29:28,256 --> 01:29:30,256
Sara...

926
01:29:33,656 --> 01:29:35,656
Sara...

927
01:29:39,856 --> 01:29:41,656
Daddy...

928
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:47,656
Daddy, daddy! It is you! I found
you, I found you!

929
01:29:48,056 --> 01:29:50,338
They said you were dead,
but I knew you weren't.

930
01:29:50,363 --> 01:29:51,480
I knew you'd come back.

931
01:29:51,856 --> 01:29:58,056
Oh daddy, hold me, hold me close.
You won't ever go away again, will you?

932
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:04,256
What's the matter daddy? Why
won't you talk to me?

933
01:30:05,056 --> 01:30:08,656
Don't you know me daddy? I'm
Sara, I'm Sara.

934
01:30:09,656 --> 01:30:13,656
- Where is my daughter?
- Oh daddy, something's happened to you.

935
01:30:14,256 --> 01:30:18,456
Mr. Bertie! Mr. Bertie! Oh daddy,
you've got to know me.

936
01:30:18,856 --> 01:30:21,456
Look at me!

937
01:30:26,256 --> 01:30:31,056
You mustn't cry. You mustn't cry.

938
01:30:31,856 --> 01:30:34,856
- We must be good soldiers you know.
- But I have

939
01:30:34,881 --> 01:30:37,880
been a good soldier daddy,
but you don't know me.

940
01:30:38,256 --> 01:30:44,256
- My little Sara never cries.
- But I'm Sara, I'm Sara!

941
01:30:49,856 --> 01:30:53,456
Yes, yes,...Sara! Sara!

942
01:30:54,656 --> 01:30:57,456
Sara, my darling. My baby Sara.

943
01:30:59,256 --> 01:31:03,256
Sara my darling. My little Sara.

944
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:11,926
- Oh don't be ridiculous Amanada.
- Well then how do you account for

945
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:14,632
those silk covers, those robes and
those other things that are there.

946
01:31:14,656 --> 01:31:17,536
Perhaps a little bird brought them in.
Perhaps they grew legs and walked

947
01:31:17,561 --> 01:31:20,480
in. I don't know. One thing I do know
is little Sara wouldn't steal them.

948
01:31:20,856 --> 01:31:23,234
Bertie! Yes?
Berties, what do you think has happened?

949
01:31:23,259 --> 01:31:25,680
Little Princess has found her father.
She's found him!

950
01:31:26,056 --> 01:31:28,293
- Captain Crew is alive?
- Of course he's alive!

951
01:31:28,318 --> 01:31:30,280
How could she find him
if he wasn't alive?

952
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:38,256
- Oh Mr. Bertie, I found my father.
- Darling, I'm so glad.

953
01:31:40,456 --> 01:31:42,856
Daddy, it's Your Majesty.

954
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:55,656
My daddy.

1
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:28,422
- Now, now, don't get
nasty my little friends,

2
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,674
your bumping's not gonna hurt you one bit.

3
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:33,593
Just relax and sleep.

4
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,895
Sleep, sleep, sleep

5
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,101
and in the morning you'll find
yourselves in your new home.

6
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:43,979
Eh, my pets?

7
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:37,008
Good morning, Doc, what you got there?

8
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:40,345
Alvin, I found some new friends.

9
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,264
Listen.

10
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:46,274
Wasps?

11
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,562
You better be careful, they
can sting a man to death.

12
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,230
Don't worry, we understand each other.

13
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:52,482
They know who their friend is.

14
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,275
They can tell.

15
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:56,528
Yeah, but they know when you ain't too.

16
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:58,036
Ah, nonsense.

17
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,386
If you knew about wasps what I know,

18
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,728
you'd have no fear of them my boy.

19
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,036
No fear.

20
00:06:31,605 --> 00:06:33,982
- Hey you,
give us a hand here!

21
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,233
Hello there, Mr. Barker.

22
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,987
Surprised to see you out
here in the field, sir.

23
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:40,947
How are things running
at the front office?

24
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:44,541
Smooth as honey, Renfro.

25
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,870
I see here you turned in
over a thousand pounds

26
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,456
of orange blossom honey and 400 of beeswax

27
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,892
last month, Renfro, congratulations,

28
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,294
you've made the top of the list again.

29
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,295
Why, thank you sir.

30
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:59,945
- Holiday Honey needs
your kinda man, Renfro.

31
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,844
You stay with it and I
can see a bright future

32
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,977
for you with the company.

33
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:06,139
Well I do try to do my best, Mr. Barker.

34
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:09,434
I try to take my
inspiration from the bees,

35
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,353
always busy, busy, busy.

36
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:14,613
Yes.

37
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,442
Now what about this fellow, Dr. Zinthrop?

38
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:18,950
Zinthrop?

39
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,883
Boy, there's a nut, him and his bees.

40
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,788
You know it wouldn't surprise me someday

41
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,623
to see him flapping his arms, taking off

42
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:27,125
after some queen bee with
the rest of the drones.

43
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,080
- Mm-hmm, well he's paid to
do research on royal jelly.

44
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,832
Haven't had a progress
report from him in a month.

45
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,273
- Hmm, well, he has a
little workshop up there,

46
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:38,755
back of the orange grove,
keeps a few colonies.

47
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,258
- I suppose I better go
up there and take a look.

48
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:50,357
Hey you!

49
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:52,525
Where's this fellow Zinthrop?

50
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,939
- Oh, he's up where the
extractor is, up there!

51
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,858
Hey, hey, this isn't a honey bee.

52
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,361
These are wasps.

53
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:02,535
Wasps!

54
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,579
Who's responsible for this?

55
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,512
Most likely Dr. Zinthrop, sir.

56
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,410
I told you he was a crackpot.

57
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,703
Zinthrop, huh?

58
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:11,496
Zinthrop.

59
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:38,148
Zinthrop!

60
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,693
Zinthrop!

61
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,254
Now look here, Zinthrop,

62
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:56,833
what's all this nonsense about wasps?

63
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,342
I'm so glad you dropped in, Mr. Barker.

64
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:02,964
Mr. Barker, I'm on the
verge of a great discovery.

65
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,848
Discovery, what do you mean?

66
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:08,553
- Well, sir, I almost
perfected a new method

67
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:12,188
of extracting royal jelly
from the queen wasp.

68
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:14,809
- According to my figures you're
better at extracting funds

69
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:15,817
from the company.

70
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:16,985
Now look here, Zinthrop,

71
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,981
over $1,000 last month for miscellaneous.

72
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:21,750
Yes, yes, I know, but Mr. Barker,

73
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,531
let me just show you something.

74
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,278
Just let me show you something.

75
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:29,699
Already I've learned to
slow the process of aging.

76
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,492
Soon,

77
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:34,037
I shall be able to reverse it entirely.

78
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:38,479
What are you getting at, Zinthrop?

79
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:41,086
Look, what do you see?

80
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,714
I see a big dog and a little dog.

81
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,093
Let's say an old dog and a young dog.

82
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:50,720
All right, so what?

83
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,598
But they're exactly the same age.

84
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:57,525
You see, the little one
Greta has been given

85
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,481
regular injections of my
compound from the queen wasp.

86
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,442
Just like I told ya, Mr. Barker.

87
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:10,198
- Now look here, Zinthrop,
I understand about science

88
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,326
and progress and all that
but you were attained

89
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:16,263
to extract queen bee royal jelly.

90
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:19,130
Now it's a health food, a cosmetic.

91
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,085
It's not a miracle drug
or an elixir of youth,

92
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,188
that sort of thing is impossible.

93
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,256
- Oh, but Mr. Barker-
- Zinthrop,

94
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,715
I'm sorry, Zinthrop, but

95
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,552
I'm gonna have to let you go.

96
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:33,930
You just don't seem to be one of the team.

97
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:36,940
You understand.

98
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,561
Good luck, I'm sure
you'll fit in somewhere.

99
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:45,817
Fit in.

100
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:47,110
Somewhere.

101
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:03,126
Oh, now, now, don't worry, my friends.

102
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:06,379
We shall find a home somehow.

103
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:07,172
Somewhere.

104
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:11,279
Oh but you sound impatient.

105
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:13,726
I know, it's your babies, huh?

106
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:15,805
They're hungry and they must be fed.

107
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:22,896
Now, how would you like a
nice, juicy little caterpillar?

108
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,647
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

109
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:25,440
There.

110
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,943
Now you must eat and be strong because,

111
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:32,655
well, a lot of work to do together.

112
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:34,449
Yes sir.

113
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:39,454
A lot of work.

114
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,725
As you can see, gentlemen,

115
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,097
sales for the last fiscal
quarter have dropped.

116
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:01,226
14 and one half percent.

117
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,395
There's not been a corresponding drop

118
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,813
in our competitor's sales.

119
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,742
I trust one of you gentlemen has a

120
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:13,321
satisfactory explanation for this decline.

121
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:18,409
Not one little suggestion, gentlemen?

122
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,621
We'll start with you, Thompson.

123
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:25,423
As Public Relations Manager,
no doubt you have some

124
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,711
faint glimmering of what's
happening to Starlin Products.

125
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:29,504
Well, Thompson?

126
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,680
- Well, you see, I-
- I had no idea

127
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,676
you were such an excellent
public speaker, Thompson.

128
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:36,678
- Oh, I'm sorry Miss
Starlin, I guess I'm not

129
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,551
feeling very well this morning.

130
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:40,355
I'm sorry you aren't.

131
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,059
- I think I can tell
you why Starlin Products

132
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:45,270
are falling off so badly, Miss Starlin.

133
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,153
We're listening, Lane.

134
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,941
Where would you put the
responsibility for this decline?

135
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:52,902
On you, Miss Starlin.

136
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:56,322
I imagine you

137
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:00,875
have arguments to support that contention?

138
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,955
- We've all been looking at
it for the past 20 minutes.

139
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,000
The most convincing argument
is right on that graph.

140
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:09,919
May I show you?

141
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:12,880
Thank you.

142
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:17,927
Now right here in April
is when Starlin's sales

143
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,352
started falling off.

144
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:20,680
Very clever of you, Lane.

145
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,934
- Would you mind waiting
until I finish, Miss Starlin?

146
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,978
- That's enough, Lane.
- Relax, Willis.

147
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,441
My apologies for the interruption, go on.

148
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:32,400
Thank you.

149
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,244
Now as I said, sales
began to fall in April.

150
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,157
But the reason for the fall
was back here in February.

151
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,751
Starlin Products have
always been thought of

152
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:47,081
as something of a modern
miracle in the cosmetics trade.

153
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,898
A firm built to a
multi-million-dollar-a-year business

154
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:53,755
on the strength and appeal of
one person, Janice Starlin.

155
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:57,133
From the beginning right
through until February

156
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,444
of this year, only one woman's face

157
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,721
was used to advertise those products.

158
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:03,604
Your face, Miss Starlin.

159
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,267
The public have come to accept you as a,

160
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:07,567
as a symbol.

161
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:10,813
Now, after 16 years, they
see a different face,

162
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,228
they don't trust it.

163
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,608
They feel cheated.

164
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,660
The simple fact is that Starlin Cosmetics

165
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:20,907
should have Janice Starlin's
picture advertising them.

166
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,992
Well that's about all I've got to say.

167
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,079
And a darn good job of saying it, too.

168
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:27,003
I agree.

169
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:29,791
- Lane makes a lot of sense
on that score, Miss Starlin.

170
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,084
I think I've had enough

171
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,836
flattery for one morning, gentlemen.

172
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:39,015
It was a very convincing argument, Lane.

173
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,475
- There's a Mr.
Zinthrop to see Miss Starlin.

174
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,012
- There's only one small
factor you've overlooked.

175
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,139
Not even Janice Starlin can

176
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,393
remain a glamour girl forever.

177
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:49,578
Miss Starlin.

178
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:50,693
Yes, Mary?

179
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:52,563
There's a Mr. Zinthrop in reception,

180
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:54,023
he says he has an appointment.

181
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:54,816
Thank you.

182
00:14:57,276 --> 00:15:00,822
Well, this has been a very
informative get together,

183
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:01,948
that'll be all for now.

184
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,842
Oh, Arthur?
- Yes, Miss Starlin?

185
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,296
- I'd like to see you
in my office, please.

186
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,714
Sure, Miss Starlin.

187
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:21,300
Take it easy, hot shot.

188
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,649
Something on your mind, Miss Starlin?

189
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:32,728
- You've done some work on
royal jelly, haven't you?

190
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:33,521
A little.

191
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,443
- Are there any real
therapeutic values in it?

192
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:39,867
Oh, I'd say so.

193
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:42,405
Course a lot depends on each individual's

194
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,031
reaction to the stuff.

195
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:46,249
What do you mean?

196
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:49,537
- Just that no two people react
in precisely the same way.

197
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,457
One man's meat's another man's poison.

198
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:54,542
Oh.

199
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:59,505
But you think royal jelly can
be beneficial in some cases?

200
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:02,425
Queen bees set a lot of store by it.

201
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:06,095
- I'll accept that as
an affirmative answer.

202
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,482
Supposing a more powerful
form of royal jelly

203
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:14,520
could be obtained, from
the queen wasp for example.

204
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,336
I mean, do you suppose that might have

205
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:20,908
some rejuvenating effect on a human being?

206
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:24,071
- I'd stay away from wasps
if I were you, Miss Starlin.

207
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,032
Socially the queen wasp is on a level

208
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,832
with the black widow spider.

209
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,786
They're both carnivorous,
they paralyze their victims

210
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:33,706
and then take their time
devouring them alive.

211
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,750
They kill their mates in the same way too.

212
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,669
Strictly a one-sided romance.

213
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:45,134
Well, I'm not exactly interested in

214
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,137
the love life of the queen wasp.

215
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:53,538
I want your opinion on
the possibilities of using

216
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:56,569
enzyme extracts from royal
wasp jelly, commercially.

217
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:59,565
- Well, if you want an honest
opinion, Miss Starlin-

218
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,567
Of course I want an honest opinion.

219
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,362
Then my advice is forget about it.

220
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:10,583
Thank you, Arthur.

221
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,411
Any time, Miss Starlin.

222
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:25,925
- Have Mr. Zinthrop come in.
- Yes, Miss Starlin.

223
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,635
You can go in now, sir.
- Oh.

224
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:33,856
'Bout time.

225
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,393
Janice Starlin Enterprises.

226
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,572
Miss Starlin?

227
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:44,075
Yes, how do you do?

228
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,987
I'm afraid I won't be able
to give you much time,

229
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,328
Mr. Zinthrop.

230
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:50,575
- But it is I who give you
the time, Miss Starlin.

231
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,994
Oh yes, plenty of time I give you, 10,

232
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,371
maybe 15 years I give you.

233
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,085
- I want you to understand
one thing very clearly,

234
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,253
Mr. Zinthrop.

235
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,860
I expect absolute proof
of what you claimed

236
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:08,217
in your letter, tangible proof, not words.

237
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:12,013
- Such proof you shall
get, Madam, and more.

238
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,933
But I think I better show
you in the laboratory, yes?

239
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:20,083
All right.

240
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,480
Come along.

241
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:31,198
Look.

242
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:33,868
They look terrible.

243
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,711
Why don't you put them
out of their misery?

244
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:39,165
- Madam, you asked for
proof, please be kind enough

245
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,459
to look at the proof you asked for.

246
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:42,251
May I proceed?

247
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:44,337
Thank you.

248
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:04,607
Come, come, come little one.

249
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:19,830
In a few minutes, Madam,
we shall see a miracle

250
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:20,915
you shall not believe.

251
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,758
Oh, no tricks,

252
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:26,942
you may look if you
like, I have no tricks.

253
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:30,091
Well, don't look at me, I'm not changing.

254
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:54,740
I don't believe it, it's not possible.

255
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,370
I see you do not believe one animal,

256
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,414
so I bring two.

257
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,522
I show you again, yes?

258
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:07,628
Yes, I must be sure.

259
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:13,551
Yes, Madam.

260
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,806
There.

261
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:38,200
Well, Miss Starlin, does my secret

262
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,543
have interest for you, yes?

263
00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:42,413
What are your terms, Mr. Zinthrop?

264
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:45,812
First, I must have a laboratory equipped

265
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:48,134
with everything I need for my research.

266
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,505
If we're successful, well, I
ask for a little percentage.

267
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:55,092
But I must get full
credit for my discovery,

268
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:56,761
that is most important to me.

269
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:00,222
I'll have Gordon draw up the contracts.

270
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,617
Oh, contracts, contracts I do not need,

271
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,977
you give me your word, good enough for me.

272
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:09,899
You amaze me.

273
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,027
Frankly, when I received
your letter I thought

274
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:15,446
you were just another eccentric.

275
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,824
But there was always a
chance you might not be.

276
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:19,992
Then you walk in here and show me

277
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:22,077
nothing short of a miracle.

278
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:23,461
Two miracles.

279
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:25,456
And you say that you'll accept my word

280
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:26,624
that I won't cheat you.

281
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:27,416
You won't.

282
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,551
I know you're a good woman,

283
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:33,172
even if you do not like
other people to know it.

284
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:38,636
However, my formula may not
be good for human beings,

285
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:40,054
I have not tested yet.

286
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,689
You will, on me.

287
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:46,393
- Oh, no, no, no, no,
there might be danger.

288
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,611
Those are my terms, Mr. Zinthrop.

289
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:50,815
Janice Starlin will be
your next guinea pig.

290
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,408
Very well.

291
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:57,070
Though it may take a
little time to prepare

292
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:59,663
a sufficient extract, a week, maybe more.

293
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,325
- I'll make whatever
arrangements you may need

294
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,948
for your equipment.

295
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,502
Thank you, Madam.

296
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:07,498
Now I see how you built all this.

297
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,753
- I'm very close to
losing it, Mr. Zinthrop.

298
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:15,673
Maybe working together we can save

299
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,174
Janice Starlin Enterprises,

300
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,011
maybe even make it
bigger than ever before.

301
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:22,259
Yes.

302
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:23,472
Oh, yes.

303
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,789
- I'm sure the next
three months we will see

304
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:30,855
a rise in Starlin sales that will surpass

305
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,565
anything we've dared imagine.

306
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,774
Mr. Zinthrop...

307
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:38,278
Is working on the final
stages of a development

308
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,923
that will revolutionize
the cosmetics industry.

309
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,664
He's to have a free
hand in his experiments

310
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:46,494
and will be answerable
to no one but myself.

311
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:49,255
At the moment I cannot divulge the nature

312
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,627
of Mr. Zinthrop's experiments
but I can assure you

313
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:56,255
it will bring world-wide recognition

314
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,424
to Janice Starlin Enterprises.

315
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:32,339
- I dunno, this Zinthrop
must be the granddaddy

316
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:35,878
of all confidence men to have
taken a gal like Starlin.

317
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:37,671
Now why doesn't somebody wise her up?

318
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:42,266
Like you, for instance?

319
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,803
Bill, what makes you think Zinthrop

320
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:46,055
really isn't on the level?

321
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:48,974
After all, we don't even
know what he's working on,

322
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,014
it could be very legitimate.

323
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,020
You're as bad as she is.

324
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:54,772
Oh, women.

325
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:58,400
Men.

326
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:01,674
Every time you're stuck for an answer

327
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,447
you always come up with, "Women."

328
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:07,159
You're not getting out
of this one so easily.

329
00:24:08,285 --> 00:24:09,954
I'd like to know why you think Zinthrop

330
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:12,004
really hasn't got something.

331
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,381
- Well you can call it
male intuition if you like.

332
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,210
It's just that there's something
about this whole business

333
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:17,760
that doesn't smell right.

334
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:20,839
The private laboratory,
the secret experiments,

335
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:22,514
Zinthrop himself.

336
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:25,552
The only thing that's missing
is a genie with a lamp.

337
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:29,306
You better leave the intuition to me.

338
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:32,768
Come on, I'll let you buy me dinner.

339
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:33,560
Buy you dinner?

340
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:35,861
What's happened to your sporting blood?

341
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:38,065
I thought we were gonna
toss for the check.

342
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,490
Oh no,

343
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:40,943
you won the last three times.

344
00:24:41,986 --> 00:24:44,300
- All right, look, I'll
make a deal with you.

345
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:46,615
Dinner is on me if you
promise to keep an eye

346
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,825
on what goes on in there.

347
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:50,577
- Oh, what do you want
me to do, read her mail

348
00:24:50,612 --> 00:24:52,746
and send you messages in secret code?

349
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:53,747
You could do worse.

350
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,591
Oh no, Mr. Cooper, not you too.

351
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,051
- I've been trying to
tell bright eyes here

352
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:02,464
that I think Zinthrop is a
phony and a confidence man.

353
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,800
- If I were sure of that
I wouldn't be worried.

354
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,427
I think he's a lot more dangerous.

355
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:07,476
A quack.

356
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:08,971
Well, I don't follow you, Coop.

357
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:09,895
Well, a confidence man

358
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,189
would just be interested in your money.

359
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:15,144
The only damage they can
do is to your pocket book.

360
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,271
A quack can be fatal.

361
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:27,788
- So I says to him, I
says, "Listen Irving,

362
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:30,534
"I'm getting sick of this
TV every night, I mean,

363
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:33,245
"you know, we can do the
same thing in a night club."

364
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,132
Well, almost.

365
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:41,920
Good morning, Janice Starlin Enterprises.

366
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,799
I got two words for ya,

367
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,047
drop dead.

368
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:48,260
Twice.

369
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,644
Irving?

370
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,681
Calls me to tell me Dr. Cyclops

371
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,683
is on channel nine tonight.

372
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:55,482
What a crust.

373
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:59,021
He's seen it twice already.

374
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,940
Good morning.

375
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:08,864
Is Miss Starlin in her office now?

376
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,165
Miss Starlin's in conference.

377
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,076
Would you like to speak to her secretary?

378
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:14,918
Oh, no, no, no, just say to Miss Starlin

379
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:17,790
I should like to see her
when she has time, huh?

380
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:18,582
Yes sir.

381
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,047
Was there something else, Mr. Zinthrop?

382
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,548
No, no, no, no, goodbye.

383
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:32,596
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

384
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:47,194
What a character, a regular
two-eyed Dr. Cyclops.

385
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:48,577
Even the bow.

386
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,573
- "Good morning, may I
see Miss Zarlin, please?"

387
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,917
He's a real weirdy.

388
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:57,329
Wonder what his game is.
- Who cares.

389
00:26:57,364 --> 00:26:59,706
You know, Morton thinks he's a crackpot,

390
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:01,166
I heard him telling Cooper so.

391
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:04,962
Old bug eyes really has the execs worried.

392
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:05,844
About what?

393
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,965
That's just it, they don't know.

394
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,348
Oh.

395
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:11,844
So anyway, back to Irving.

396
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,946
- Good morning, Miss
Starlin, good morning.

397
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,407
- Good morning, I couldn't
get away any sooner,

398
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:34,199
is it important?

399
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:38,787
- Miss Starlin, do you
remember the big cat

400
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:40,497
I showed you last week, no?

401
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,423
What about it?

402
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,962
Well, I want you to look at him, come.

403
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:54,393
No.

404
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:55,721
Quite a difference, yes?

405
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:00,851
Why, it's incredible!

406
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:03,145
The same mark.

407
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,563
Same cat.

408
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:09,276
- You're young again, can
you realize what that means?

409
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:10,444
You're a kitten again.

410
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:13,030
Your whole life to live over.

411
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:15,539
How does it feel?

412
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,701
- I think perhaps you'll
be able to find out

413
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:19,912
for yourself, Miss Starlin.

414
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:21,830
Today...

415
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:26,293
Today will be your first injection.

416
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:28,503
Come.

417
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,229
Sit down, please.

418
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:28,480
- Mr. Gleason, of
accounting, on line three.

419
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:32,901
What is it, Gleason?

420
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:36,078
I sent you a memo.

421
00:29:36,113 --> 00:29:37,656
Mr. Zinthrop has carte Blanche

422
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:39,199
to order anything he requires.

423
00:29:40,784 --> 00:29:42,661
It is no concern of yours, Gleason.

424
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:44,538
Make out a check for the full amount.

425
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:51,649
Sue?

426
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:53,178
Mary.

427
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,173
Can I talk to Mr. Lane a minute, please?

428
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:01,311
Bill?

429
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:05,017
Hey, listen, Gleason just
got a bill for $2,300.

430
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:07,561
Zinthrop.

431
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,150
Enzyme extracts.

432
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,228
Yes, yes, yes, we are making progress,

433
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,626
there's great improvement in the tissue.

434
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:35,297
Why is it taking so long?

435
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:36,722
It's the third week.

436
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:39,016
You forget, my dear,

437
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:41,470
there's more to you than
a little kitten, no?

438
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:44,806
Besides, there's a
difference in metabolism.

439
00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:47,941
Why not increase the dosage?

440
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,437
Wouldn't that step up the process?

441
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:52,863
Patience, my dear, patience.

442
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:56,693
We must tread lightly, with
care, your arm, please.

443
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,293
There.

444
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:17,005
You know, I've been experimenting with

445
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,723
a concentrated solution of the enzymes,

446
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:22,052
oh a great deal more
powerful than the solution

447
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:24,054
I've been using in your injection.

448
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,114
Oh?

449
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,104
Yes.

450
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:29,434
And I think, I think it
will be better for lotions,

451
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:32,729
as an emollient lotion
it'll make estrogenic creams

452
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:34,564
and all such products old fashioned.

453
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:39,194
My dear, Starlin will be world famous,

454
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:41,130
bringing you to millions.

455
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,031
If you're right, Zinthrop,

456
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,867
there are going to be a few red faces

457
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:48,043
in my advertising department.

458
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:50,122
But I am right, why your own mirror

459
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,755
will tell you that I am right.

460
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,875
Why, you look at least five years younger

461
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,710
than you looked three weeks ago.

462
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,712
I know.

463
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:42,591
- Will you let me talk
to Bill a minute, Sue?

464
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:43,383
Thanks.

465
00:32:45,177 --> 00:32:47,012
Bill, I think I've got it.

466
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:50,015
Yeah, I'm a nervous wreck.

467
00:32:51,725 --> 00:32:53,018
At lunch, at lunch.

468
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:56,000
You'll have to translate for me, Coop,

469
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:57,898
I'm not very good at that technical stuff.

470
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:58,982
Pseudo-technical.

471
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:02,694
Our Mr. Zinthrop's a very
capable confidence man

472
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:04,828
from what I read in this letter.

473
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:07,866
He claims he can stimulate
the processes of rejuvenation

474
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:11,453
through the use of enzymes
extracted from wasps.

475
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:12,454
Oh, for...

476
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:17,292
- Well, what are you two
Sherlocks going to do about it?

477
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,508
Right now I don't know.

478
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,086
- Frankly I'm getting tired
of the whole business.

479
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:21,970
That woman's so intent
on holding back time

480
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:24,508
she's ready to fall for the
first phony line she hears.

481
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:25,797
Wasps.

482
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:27,017
Bill.

483
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:28,894
Face the facts, Mary, Janice Starlin

484
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,368
has built her whole life
on youth and beauty.

485
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,773
Now that she's losing them
she's scared to death.

486
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:36,735
Right now she's on cloud
nine with that quack Zinthrop

487
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,231
but I'd hate to be around when
she comes back down to Earth.

488
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:41,441
Well maybe we can let her down easy.

489
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:42,734
I think we owe her that much.

490
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:43,527
Yeah.

491
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:45,744
What are we gonna do?

492
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,885
We can't just let Zinthrop
build up her hopes

493
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,991
and then knock the props
out from under her.

494
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:52,869
How can he do such a terrible thing?

495
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:53,787
Poor Jan.

496
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:58,041
There must be something we
can do before it's too late.

497
00:33:58,076 --> 00:34:00,418
He's got a mighty convincing argument.

498
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:01,920
Very impressive to the layman.

499
00:34:03,255 --> 00:34:06,049
10 to one he's got a
record just as impressive.

500
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:07,557
There are ways to find out.

501
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:10,053
The answer might be
right here in our hands.

502
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,722
Heads.

503
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,235
I'm gonna keep this
letter for a day or two.

504
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,647
- Wait a minute, suppose
she finds out it's gone,

505
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:22,524
I'm the only one with access to that desk,

506
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,949
she'll know I took it.

507
00:34:23,984 --> 00:34:25,464
That's a chance you have to take, Mary.

508
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:26,945
I think we can be pretty sure that Coop

509
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,860
knows what he's doing, honey.

510
00:34:28,895 --> 00:34:30,740
Well come on, young lovers.

511
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,921
What is it, Maureen?

512
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:08,624
It is you, Miss Starlin?

513
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:10,293
Of course it's me.

514
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:12,420
Who did you think it was?

515
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:14,672
You look so different.

516
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:18,134
Finish your nails.

517
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:23,952
Maureen.

518
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:25,023
Hmm?

519
00:38:25,058 --> 00:38:26,810
I think your phone is ringing.

520
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:29,062
Oh, yes, Miss Starlin.

521
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:33,983
Good morning, Janice Starlin Enterprises.

522
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:38,912
Gentlemen, Janice Starlin Enterprises

523
00:38:38,947 --> 00:38:42,992
is about to start on the most
wide-spread publicity campaign

524
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:44,953
in the history of the cosmetic industry.

525
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:50,667
Our slogan will be, "Return
to youth with Janice Starlin."

526
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,129
When Mr. Zinthrop arrives,
there will be a press interview

527
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:57,715
and all questions regarding
the rejuvenation process

528
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,883
will be referred to him.

529
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:03,394
That'll be all for now, gentlemen.

530
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:04,896
- It's amazing.
- Why, it's wonderful.

531
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,058
- Absolutely amazing.
- You look marvelous.

532
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:09,185
- I said that will be
all for now, gentlemen.

533
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:11,229
Good morning.

534
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:18,653
Oh not you, Mary, wait a moment, please.

535
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:21,447
Yes, Miss Starlin?

536
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:32,173
Mary, isn't it wonderful?

537
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:36,004
It's a miracle, a wonderful,
incredible miracle!

538
00:39:37,213 --> 00:39:38,596
We were so worried about you,

539
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:40,508
we really thought you were in danger.

540
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:43,094
We even went to plotting how to rescue you

541
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:44,178
from Mr. Zinthrop.

542
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:50,059
It all seems so silly,
it seems ridiculous.

543
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:50,852
Oh Mary,

544
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,980
Mary, how old do I look?

545
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,958
Tell me, how old?

546
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,901
How old do I look?

547
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:58,877
Tell me!

548
00:39:58,912 --> 00:39:59,819
How old?

549
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:04,914
23?

550
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,326
Maybe 22?

551
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:11,664
That's how old I was when I started

552
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:13,166
Janice Starlin Enterprises.

553
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,627
Do you realize what that means?

554
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:19,339
I'm back where I started, 18 years ago,

555
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,467
with what it took 18 years to accomplish.

556
00:40:25,386 --> 00:40:26,846
It's like a dream.

557
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:24,988
- 30 years ago a bunch of
quacks were treating people

558
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:26,788
with monkey glands.

559
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:28,804
Seemed to work for a while.

560
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,785
Then the deterioration set in.

561
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,577
That's awful.

562
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,498
Do you think that will happen to Jan?

563
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:36,290
I don't know.

564
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,961
If I could just get inside of his lab and

565
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:41,796
run a breakdown on what he's using.

566
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:55,304
Mr. Zinthrop!

567
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:06,732
Mr. Zinthrop?

568
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,321
Mr. Zinthrop?

569
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:01,078
I want you to find him, Mr. Hellman,

570
00:45:01,113 --> 00:45:02,639
I don't care what it costs.

571
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:04,130
We'll find him all right,

572
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:05,791
sooner or later we find them all.

573
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:08,920
Time is vital, Mr. Hellman.

574
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:11,721
Every hour he's gone,

575
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:14,550
it means more than you
can possibly imagine.

576
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:17,466
- Well, you haven't given
me very much to go on.

577
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:20,348
No home address, no
former employer, no phone,

578
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:22,308
this is just like starting from scratch.

579
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:25,353
Mr. Zinthrop wasn't a,

580
00:45:26,354 --> 00:45:27,605
a conventional employee.

581
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:31,192
He didn't go through regular personnel.

582
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:31,984
Uh-huh.

583
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:34,904
You say he came here about a month ago,

584
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:36,746
well how did he come here, Miss Starlin?

585
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:39,033
He just didn't walk in
off the street, did he?

586
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:41,702
The letter.

587
00:45:42,662 --> 00:45:43,829
Right here in my drawer.

588
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:50,753
- Maybe one
of the other drawers?

589
00:45:53,172 --> 00:45:55,299
So that's what she meant?

590
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:56,133
What who meant?

591
00:46:00,805 --> 00:46:01,847
Miss Starlin?

592
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:05,559
The letter's been taken and
you think you know who took it,

593
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:06,352
is that right?

594
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,030
My secretary, Miss Dennison.

595
00:46:11,065 --> 00:46:12,566
You got her address handy?

596
00:46:13,526 --> 00:46:14,325
Her phone number.

597
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,758
- It might be better if
I busted in on her cold.

598
00:46:16,793 --> 00:46:19,156
This way she'll have a
chance to prepare a story.

599
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:20,866
I know what I'm doing.

600
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:22,322
All right.

601
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:23,709
Mary?

602
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:25,503
Janice Starlin.

603
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:27,873
- Before I went to lunch
I made a duplicate copy

604
00:46:27,908 --> 00:46:29,250
of Mr. Zinthrop's letter.

605
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:33,212
I was going to take that one
to Bill and Mr. Cooper at first

606
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,300
but then I thought that the
original would be better.

607
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:38,467
Have you got the copy?

608
00:46:39,427 --> 00:46:40,851
Yes, it's in my desk.

609
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:42,388
Get that copy, Miss Dennison.

610
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:47,601
Uh-huh, 946 West 73rd Street, Manhattan.

611
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:50,476
Yeah, that's right, get right on it, Jerry

612
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:53,316
and check back with me as soon as you can.

613
00:49:01,944 --> 00:49:02,736
Yeah?

614
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:05,239
Oh?

615
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,159
You're sure he's our boy?

616
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:10,369
Uh-huh.

617
00:49:10,404 --> 00:49:11,537
Is he?

618
00:49:12,538 --> 00:49:14,290
Central emergency.

619
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:16,017
Mm-hmm.

620
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:17,675
Right.

621
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,343
Well, it looks like we've got him.

622
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:21,172
There's a John Doe down
at central emergency,

623
00:49:21,207 --> 00:49:22,179
auto accident.

624
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:24,216
There's no identification
on him but he was wearing

625
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:26,725
a lab smock and fills
Zinthrop's description.

626
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,263
- Mary, get my coat and
Lane, get a cab downstairs.

627
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,440
Is he badly hurt?

628
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:34,643
- Head injury, general
contusion to the body.

629
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:42,338
- He's had a severe injury
and there's definite

630
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:44,862
brain damage, just how
much we can't tell as yet.

631
00:49:44,897 --> 00:49:46,579
How long before you'll know?

632
00:49:46,614 --> 00:49:48,240
It's hard to say, Miss Starlin.

633
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:52,203
- Who's the best man
for this kind of injury?

634
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:53,996
Well, there's several top specialists.

635
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:55,254
Get the best,

636
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:58,334
I'll take full responsibility
for the expenses.

637
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:00,002
Yes, Miss Starlin.

638
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:11,222
I don't know, Arthur.

639
00:50:12,306 --> 00:50:14,023
I think it best we wait.

640
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:16,956
- It's been three days
since the accident, Jan,

641
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:19,855
and no sign of improvement,
he's still in a coma.

642
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,666
You heard what the doctor said.

643
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:23,407
He may never regain consciousness.

644
00:50:23,442 --> 00:50:25,152
And even if he does, who knows how badly

645
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:26,487
his brain has been damaged.

646
00:50:31,283 --> 00:50:32,076
Well,

647
00:50:33,118 --> 00:50:34,787
I'll give it another 48 hours.

648
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:38,582
If he doesn't regain
consciousness by then,

649
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,253
you can take over the laboratory, Arthur.

650
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:43,093
Janice.

651
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:44,046
It's my decision.

652
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:27,506
- It's incredible, right
in front of our noses.

653
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,093
He can't have used it all.

654
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,514
I could run a qualitative analysis.

655
00:53:07,356 --> 00:53:10,484
- Confounded thing,
always goes on the fritz

656
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,945
right in the middle of a good program.

657
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:39,972
- I want this to be the
biggest advertising campaign

658
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:42,474
in the history of cosmetic advertising.

659
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:45,811
Every newspaper and
magazine in the country

660
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:48,080
will be flooded with our new slogan,

661
00:53:48,115 --> 00:53:50,315
"Return to youth with Janice Starlin."

662
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,443
Excuse me, Miss Starlin.

663
00:53:53,402 --> 00:53:54,827
What is it, Thompson?

664
00:53:54,862 --> 00:53:56,488
- I think we should be
a little conservative,

665
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:59,498
Miss Starlin, cosmetics are one thing,

666
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:02,703
medications another, we're
liable to run into trouble.

667
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:03,495
Yes.

668
00:54:05,164 --> 00:54:08,709
All advertising copy will be
cleared through your office.

669
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:10,436
It's a touchy business, you know?

670
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:12,094
Max is right, Miss Starlin.

671
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:14,882
- You don't have to
second the motion, Lane.

672
00:54:19,678 --> 00:54:22,431
I want one thing understood
very clearly now, gentlemen.

673
00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:25,517
Janice Starlin Enterprises

674
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:30,481
is going to bring the most
fantastically sellable product

675
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:34,022
ever developed by modern
cosmetics to the public.

676
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:37,529
And I don't intend to be
restricted by timidity

677
00:54:38,697 --> 00:54:41,408
on the part of my own
staff, is that clear?

678
00:54:46,038 --> 00:54:47,915
Are you all right, Miss Starlin?

679
00:54:48,874 --> 00:54:50,626
It's just a little headache, Mary.

680
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:52,669
I'm fine.

681
00:54:53,587 --> 00:54:54,678
Can I get you something?

682
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:56,882
I'm all right, I'm all right, thank you.

683
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:58,509
I have some Aspirin in my purse.

684
00:54:59,718 --> 00:55:01,595
It's all right, Mary.

685
00:55:03,514 --> 00:55:05,641
Well, that'll be all for now, gentlemen.

686
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:24,792
Hi.

687
00:55:24,827 --> 00:55:25,786
Hi, sweetie.

688
00:55:27,162 --> 00:55:29,915
- Gee, I sure hope they give
the girls working at Starlin

689
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,834
first crack at that new stuff.

690
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:33,335
Imagine being 18 again.

691
00:55:34,294 --> 00:55:37,840
- I guess if it can take
15 years off Starlin,

692
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,525
it can take 10 off you.

693
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,141
What do you mean 10?

694
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:44,888
- Face it honey, this is
Maureen you're talking to.

695
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:46,146
Yeah?

696
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:48,273
Well if I were you I'd take a double dose

697
00:55:48,308 --> 00:55:50,894
then maybe Irving wouldn't
watch television so much.

698
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:52,312
So who says he looks at it?

699
00:55:53,272 --> 00:55:55,899
I can't imagine what else he does.

700
00:55:55,934 --> 00:55:56,692
Three guesses.

701
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:00,675
- Say, did Cooper come in yet?
- Uh-uh.

702
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,948
Missed a board meeting this morning,

703
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:05,117
I bet Starlin's having a fit.

704
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:05,993
He should worry.

705
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,912
Uh-oh, see you later.

706
00:56:08,947 --> 00:56:09,913
Bye, honey.

707
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:16,670
Hi pretty puss.

708
00:56:18,338 --> 00:56:19,214
You know where

709
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:22,718
Miss Starlin's office is?

710
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:27,681
Suite number one.

711
00:56:28,682 --> 00:56:32,317
- I. Di da, the Duchess
of Flatbush herself.

712
00:56:32,352 --> 00:56:35,188
- How'd you like to have this
phone wrapped around your ear?

713
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:36,446
Wise guy.

714
00:56:36,481 --> 00:56:38,525
That's more like it, sister.

715
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,865
Suite number one.

716
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,412
Thank you.

717
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,549
Miss Starlin.

718
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:57,252
Oh, what is it, Mary?

719
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:00,637
Is there anything I can do?

720
00:57:00,672 --> 00:57:03,675
Yes, is Mr. Zinthrop's room ready?

721
00:57:04,718 --> 00:57:07,888
- Uh-huh, the nurse is fixing
the emergency equipment now

722
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:09,848
and the ambulance is due any minute.

723
00:57:10,933 --> 00:57:12,935
Be sure to let me know when it arrives.

724
00:57:13,894 --> 00:57:15,485
Oh, Mary, please, before you go,

725
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,814
could you see if you
could work that thing?

726
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:19,816
Oh, sure.

727
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,694
I've seen lots of these.

728
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:30,584
Oh, simple enough.

729
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:32,079
That'll be all, Mary, thank you.

730
00:57:32,114 --> 00:57:33,038
All right.

731
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:38,175
- We've had a room
especially made over for you,

732
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:41,296
Mr. Zinthrop and Mrs. Warren
has a room adjoining yours

733
00:57:41,331 --> 00:57:44,007
so there'll be someone
near you at all times.

734
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:46,099
Thank you, thank you.

735
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:49,603
- When you're feeling
better, Mr. Zinthrop,

736
00:57:49,638 --> 00:57:52,474
there are a few things I'd
like to discuss with you.

737
00:57:52,509 --> 00:57:53,517
Good, good.

738
00:58:04,027 --> 00:58:04,952
We'll do everything we can

739
00:58:04,987 --> 00:58:06,863
to make you comfortable, Mr. Zinthrop.

740
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:11,159
I'm going to spend the
nights here in my office

741
00:58:11,194 --> 00:58:14,162
so if anything develops, I'll be on hand.

742
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:15,122
Thank you.

743
00:58:16,915 --> 00:58:21,837
Thank you, Miss Starlin.

744
00:58:22,713 --> 00:58:23,922
Only there's something

745
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:27,717
I must tell you,

746
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:29,553
something important.

747
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:32,431
But, important but...

748
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:37,102
I cannot remember.

749
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:41,106
I'm sure it can wait.

750
00:58:42,024 --> 00:58:45,068
Right now the main thing is
to get you back to health.

751
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:48,447
Take good care of him, Mrs. Warren.

752
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:50,247
Yes, Miss Starlin.

753
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:53,125
Sure is funny about old Coop.

754
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,536
- He misses one day of
work and you're ready

755
00:58:54,571 --> 00:58:56,128
to call missing persons.

756
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:58,769
- Well, he's a pretty
conscientious guy, honey,

757
00:58:58,804 --> 00:59:01,376
if he felt sick or something
he'd have called in.

758
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:03,086
Relax, he'll probably be in bright

759
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:04,588
and chipper in the morning.

760
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:06,847
Oh, am I interrupting something?

761
00:59:06,882 --> 00:59:09,926
- Oh, we were just
having a little coffee class,

762
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:12,971
Miss Starlin, we were
talking about Mr. Cooper.

763
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,062
What about Mr. Cooper?

764
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:15,932
- Well, about his missing
the meeting this morning.

765
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:17,768
Nobody's been able to reach him all day.

766
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:19,943
I wouldn't worry about that,

767
00:59:19,978 --> 00:59:21,688
Mr. Cooper's been here a long time.

768
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,317
Probably feels he's entitled to take a day

769
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:27,284
for himself now and then.

770
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:29,717
- That's what I've
been trying to tell Mr. Lane.

771
00:59:29,752 --> 00:59:32,115
- Oh, by the way, Miss
Starlin, how is Mr. Zinthrop?

772
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,326
Oh, fine.

773
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:38,246
In a few days we'll start
the layouts for the campaign.

774
00:59:38,281 --> 00:59:40,290
I'm ready when you are, boss.

775
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:43,502
Look those over.

776
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,941
Hey, Bill.

777
00:59:45,976 --> 00:59:46,928
Hmm?

778
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:49,111
- Don't go getting any
ideas about the boss.

779
00:59:49,146 --> 00:59:51,259
- Me? Don't be silly,
I just want her to know

780
00:59:51,294 --> 00:59:52,928
that I'm an eager member of the team.

781
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:57,599
Still, she is looking a lot
younger these days, isn't she?

782
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:01,561
You think Zinthrop would give
you any of those treatments?

783
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:04,147
Break the watch or something.

784
01:00:10,195 --> 01:00:12,823
Guarantee on this too.

785
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,027
What's that?

786
01:00:44,062 --> 01:00:46,982
Lie back now, you just had a bad dream.

787
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:49,585
Lie down now, go to sleep.

788
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,616
This horrible sound.

789
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:53,237
Like a nightmare.

790
01:00:53,272 --> 01:00:54,823
Just a bad dream.

791
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:57,096
Lie down.

792
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,285
Just a dream.

793
01:01:02,038 --> 01:01:05,542
- Tell Mr. Green that personnel
is his responsibility.

794
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:08,503
I have other things to
think about than worrying

795
01:01:08,538 --> 01:01:10,463
whether the night watchman
walked off the job.

796
01:01:10,498 --> 01:01:12,806
Well that's just it, Miss Starlin,

797
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:15,781
Mr. Green feels that the
watchman never left the building.

798
01:01:15,816 --> 01:01:18,722
His lunch pail and his raincoat
are still in the basement.

799
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:23,226
- I don't want to hear
anything more about it, Mary.

800
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:28,607
All right, Miss Starlin.

801
01:01:28,642 --> 01:01:29,441
We'll use these.

802
01:01:31,234 --> 01:01:32,027
Fine.

803
01:01:34,613 --> 01:01:36,343
She swears she heard a scream

804
01:01:36,378 --> 01:01:38,039
from one of the other floors.

805
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:40,076
Zinthrop heard it too
but she convinced him

806
01:01:40,111 --> 01:01:42,095
he was having a bad dream.

807
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,080
Oh, maybe they both were.

808
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:47,132
It's not funny any more, Mary,

809
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,294
there's something going
on in that building.

810
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:52,505
And I'm gonna find out what it is.

811
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,305
How?

812
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,134
- Have a look around
Cooper's lab, for one thing.

813
01:01:56,169 --> 01:01:57,052
After that I,

814
01:01:58,178 --> 01:01:58,970
I don't know.

815
01:02:01,932 --> 01:02:02,807
Hold it steady.

816
01:02:04,351 --> 01:02:05,817
Bill, this is crazy.

817
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:07,354
We could really get in trouble.

818
01:02:13,526 --> 01:02:16,112
I won't tire him, Mrs. Warren but

819
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,156
it is important.

820
01:02:19,574 --> 01:02:21,826
- All right, Miss Starlin,
I'll be in my room.

821
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,456
Zinthrop,

822
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:29,709
Zinthrop, you've got to help me.

823
01:02:29,744 --> 01:02:30,752
Something's happening.

824
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,006
Something's happening to
me, I can't control it.

825
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,968
There's something I must remember but

826
01:02:39,052 --> 01:02:40,602
I can't.

827
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:42,013
Try to think.

828
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:43,390
The wasp enzymes,

829
01:02:44,266 --> 01:02:46,434
the extracts you were experimenting with

830
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:48,061
before the accident.

831
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:49,104
Try to think!

832
01:02:50,355 --> 01:02:53,149
I can't

833
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:56,403
Well this is Zinthrop's notebook, Mary.

834
01:02:56,438 --> 01:02:58,113
Notes on his experiments with Jan.

835
01:02:59,114 --> 01:03:01,324
Well how did Cooper get hold of it?

836
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,534
I don't know.

837
01:03:03,576 --> 01:03:04,869
If only Coop would show up.

838
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:07,414
Mary, look.

839
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:13,461
It's Mr. Cooper's pipe.

840
01:03:13,496 --> 01:03:14,552
Don't you get it?

841
01:03:14,587 --> 01:03:15,463
He'd sooner go out without his pants

842
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:16,840
than leave that pipe behind.

843
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:19,384
He's still somewhere in the building,

844
01:03:19,419 --> 01:03:21,136
I'd bet a year's salary on it.

845
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:25,307
- If he is-
- He's dead.

846
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:28,310
And the night watchman.

847
01:03:32,564 --> 01:03:35,275
- There's only enough left
for one more injection.

848
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,783
One more.

849
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:39,487
You've got to make more, Zinthrop.

850
01:03:39,522 --> 01:03:40,912
Help me, Zinthrop!

851
01:03:40,947 --> 01:03:42,490
Please, leave, my head, oh my head.

852
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:46,745
Zinthrop, help me!

853
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,121
Help me!

854
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:25,784
Is he asleep?

855
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:27,535
I don't know.

856
01:04:35,293 --> 01:04:37,093
Bill, don't touch him.

857
01:04:37,128 --> 01:04:39,672
- If anybody knows what's
behind all this, it's him.

858
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,051
Mr. Zinthrop?

859
01:04:45,303 --> 01:04:46,096
Bill.

860
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:49,349
Look it.

861
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:36,604
- Well, her coat, purse
and everything else

862
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:37,445
is still in there.

863
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,441
She wouldn't go out without her purse.

864
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:42,235
- Bill, let's get out of
here, I don't like it.

865
01:05:42,444 --> 01:05:43,361
The cat...

866
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:46,114
The cat...

867
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,449
Must warn her.

868
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:51,161
Mr. Zinthrop!

869
01:05:53,037 --> 01:05:54,003
Who are you?

870
01:05:54,038 --> 01:05:56,040
- Now there's nothing to be
alarmed about, Mr. Zinthrop,

871
01:05:56,075 --> 01:05:57,375
I'm Bill Lane and this is Miss Dennison,

872
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,081
Miss Starlin's secretary.

873
01:05:59,116 --> 01:06:00,753
Miss Starlin, the cat.

874
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:03,464
What about a cat?

875
01:06:03,499 --> 01:06:04,889
Must warn her.

876
01:06:04,924 --> 01:06:08,344
The injections, must not
take any more injections.

877
01:06:08,379 --> 01:06:10,221
Is Miss Starlin in danger?

878
01:06:10,256 --> 01:06:12,098
Terrible danger.

879
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:12,897
I must-

880
01:06:12,932 --> 01:06:13,975
- Take it easy, Mr. Zinthrop,
you're still pretty weak.

881
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,144
Mary, see if you can get Jan on the phone.

882
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:31,576
There's no answer.

883
01:06:33,995 --> 01:06:36,164
- Oh, Miss Starlin?
- Is that you, Mary?

884
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:38,333
- Where are you?
- We're in the building.

885
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:39,393
We're in Mr. Zinthrop's room.

886
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,736
Something's happened down here-

887
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:42,010
Here, let me talk to her.

888
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:43,720
Hello, Miss Starlin, this is Lane.

889
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:46,007
- Why are you and Mary
still in the building?

890
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:48,057
It's after 10.
- I must help,

891
01:06:48,092 --> 01:06:50,386
I'm responsible.
- Don't let him get up, Mary.

892
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:51,513
I must help.

893
01:06:52,764 --> 01:06:54,724
I must-
- I can't explain now, Miss Starlin.

894
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:55,642
I must go.

895
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,769
- Hang on to him.
- I must help.

896
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,121
You must not hold me back.

897
01:06:59,156 --> 01:07:00,403
Don't worry, Mr. Zinthrop,

898
01:07:00,438 --> 01:07:03,024
we won't let anything
happen to Miss Starlin.

899
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:04,876
Hello, hello, Miss Starlin.

900
01:07:04,911 --> 01:07:06,659
What's going on down there?

901
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:08,571
Stay in your office, I'll be right up.

902
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,409
Keep an eye on Zinthrop,
honey, I'm going upstairs.

903
01:07:13,444 --> 01:07:14,501
No, no, no!

904
01:07:14,536 --> 01:07:16,002
The insect, the insect!

905
01:07:16,037 --> 01:07:18,296
Take it easy, Mr. Zinthrop.

906
01:07:18,331 --> 01:07:20,500
You do not understand, Miss Starlin,

907
01:07:20,535 --> 01:07:22,759
she's in danger, I must warn.

908
01:07:22,794 --> 01:07:24,879
- Look, I'll have to stay
here, you go for Jan.

909
01:07:24,914 --> 01:07:25,678
Okay.

910
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:27,131
When you get up there, call the police,

911
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,692
you can't get outside on this phone.

912
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:30,218
All right, all right, I'll hurry.

913
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:38,059
Not the police, not the police.

914
01:07:50,738 --> 01:07:53,575
Miss Starlin!

915
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:57,870
Miss Starlin,

916
01:07:57,905 --> 01:07:59,122
it's me, Mary!

917
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:03,876
Miss Starlin, please, open the door!

918
01:08:11,217 --> 01:08:13,469
- What is it, Mary?
- Miss Starlin, please!

919
01:08:13,504 --> 01:08:14,929
Will you please call the police?

920
01:08:14,964 --> 01:08:15,812
What for?

921
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:18,182
Look, I don't have time to, never mind.

922
01:08:18,217 --> 01:08:19,225
Mary!

923
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:24,397
I'm sorry I had to do that.

924
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:26,107
There's no time for hysteria.

925
01:08:26,142 --> 01:08:27,483
Now what is this?

926
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:33,906
- The enzymes, the enzymes,
they're going crazy.

927
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:35,623
Sure, Mr. Zinthrop, you just relax

928
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:37,125
and take it easy,
everything'll be all right,

929
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,932
we'll take care of those
whatever you call those-

930
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:40,858
- You do not understand,
you do not understand,

931
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:42,749
that girl, you shouldn't
have sent her upstairs.

932
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:44,268
She's in danger, you must stop her

933
01:08:44,303 --> 01:08:45,717
before it is too late.
- Okay.

934
01:08:45,752 --> 01:08:47,128
As soon as the cops get here, we'll take-

935
01:08:47,163 --> 01:08:49,262
Oh, you fool, you fool.

936
01:08:49,297 --> 01:08:52,383
Miss Starlin will kill her
and tear her body to shreds.

937
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:54,093
Miss Starlin kill Mary?

938
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:59,182
- Miss Starlin is not a
human being any longer.

939
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:01,024
The enzymes have changed her.

940
01:09:01,059 --> 01:09:03,311
She will destroy the girl as an evil wasp

941
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:04,871
would destroy her enemies.

942
01:09:04,906 --> 01:09:06,397
And then devour the remains.

943
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:14,072
- Then Bill found Mr. Zinthrop's
notebook in Cooper's desk.

944
01:09:16,032 --> 01:09:18,207
No, no, there's no mistake,

945
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,418
we've got to call the police now.

946
01:09:20,453 --> 01:09:23,581
- Now, Mary, you're just
getting a little excited.

947
01:09:23,616 --> 01:09:26,709
Now who could possibly
want to hurt Mr. Coop...

948
01:09:28,419 --> 01:09:29,802
I don't know.

949
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,673
But it's not only Mr. Cooper.

950
01:09:32,757 --> 01:09:33,841
What about...

951
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,961
I told you, we're too late.

952
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:10,962
Mary!

953
01:10:22,432 --> 01:10:23,731
Mary!

954
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:25,810
Wait, I'll go with you.

955
01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:28,146
I can't wait, I'm gonna take the stairs.

956
01:10:28,181 --> 01:10:29,153
Oh look.

957
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,858
Laboratory, she's going to the laboratory.

958
01:10:31,893 --> 01:10:33,443
Going up the stairs.

959
01:10:40,575 --> 01:10:41,701
Mary!

960
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:46,080
Mary, Mary!

961
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:14,650
Help!

962
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,225
Get away from her!

963
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:13,626
Mary.

964
01:12:14,836 --> 01:12:15,628
Oh, Mary.

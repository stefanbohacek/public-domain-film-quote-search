1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:03,956
(upbeat militaristic music)

2
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:04,440
(cars honking)

3
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,240
Colonel Marshall,

4
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,031
I wanna impress upon you again

5
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:27,804
the vital importance
of getting those plans

6
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,157
for me immediately.

7
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,422
The exasperated entire
drive depends on them.

8
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:33,240
You understand?

9
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,698
Yes sir.

10
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:35,843
Colonel Marshal.

11
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:36,676
My plans.

12
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:40,009
Excuse me general it may be pertinent.

13
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,018
What is it soldier?

14
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:53,501
Yes sir, no sir,

15
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:56,855
the memorandum on crop circles.

16
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,651
Remarkable remember,

17
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,346
I can hold you personally
responsible for those plans.

18
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:02,179
Yes sir.

19
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:03,012
My coat.

20
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:03,845
Yes sir.

21
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,575
Olga.

22
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,822
Olga, Olga's crazy.

23
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,620
I've never given her the
slightest impression,

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,203
she runs me ragged.

25
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,906
The military police
sergeant has sent for you sir.

26
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,073
Send him in.

27
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,582
Well have you caught those two men?

28
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:35,436
No sir.

29
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:36,498
Ya see it's this way-

30
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,255
- I don't care which way it is.

31
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:39,970
Those man are A W O L.

32
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,621
Absent without leave from
the rocket for ten days.

33
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,987
Running around Paris as
if this were a picnic

34
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:46,170
instead of a war.

35
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,518
Impersonating officers,

36
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:49,718
flirting with congress men's wives.

37
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,432
Last night one of 'em had an engagement

38
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,395
to elope with a Russian
ambassador's mother in law.

39
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:55,978
And didn't keep the engagement.

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,871
The Russian ambassador is very angry.

41
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,427
Now I want those two men captured

42
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:01,934
and brought to me personally.

43
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:04,792
I'll see that they go to jail for life.

44
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,042
Here's a photograph of 'em.

45
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:14,428
Now you go out an get those men.

46
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,261
Yes sir.

47
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,274
Was the old man sore?

48
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,417
No.

49
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,178
He gave me the quantic antic on both

50
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,344
for not catchin' them AWOL guys.

51
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,940
Well how ya gonna catch 'em?

52
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,676
I ain't never even seen 'em.

53
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:41,593
The old man just gave
me a photograph of 'em.

54
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:50,335
Photograph, there ain't
no photograph on here.

55
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:51,924
Can ya beat those guys?

56
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:53,393
They got away again.

57
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:54,903
Whenever I catch 'em,

58
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:56,982
I'll bring 'em in piece by piece.

59
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:57,815
Me too.

60
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,800
Come on soldier.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,300
We got work to do.

62
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:25,857
(background chatter)

63
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,530
What's the idea, what's the idea?

64
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,867
Come come boys let's have an accounting,

65
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,127
let's have an accounting.

66
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:33,128
Why, we're just talkin' to some girls.

67
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,403
Hmm, did you hear that Thomas,

68
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:35,957
let's see your passes men.

69
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:39,078
Come come, more alert men, more alert.

70
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,298
Look them over Thomas, then report to me.

71
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:43,546
Why it's a clear infraction of rule six

72
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,792
section four, apartment three,

73
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,991
the people versus John Doe.

74
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:50,891
Mmm, just as I thought,
just as I thought.

75
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,643
I'm surprised at you men.

76
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:56,072
Acting justly towards those
whom you have sworn to love

77
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:56,905
honor and,

78
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:58,988
oh baby.

79
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:02,947
But we haven't done anything-

80
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,603
- That's enough soldiers, no buts.

81
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,592
On your way, or we'll render
you horses de combats.

82
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:09,592
Yes, scrammy, scrammy.

83
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,151
But sir you can't-

84
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,545
every time I make a dame here.

85
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:19,789
(background chatter)

86
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,565
(speaking in foreign language)

87
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:24,815
(laughing)

88
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,967
Lafayette we're there.

89
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:32,050
(background chatter)

90
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:37,434
(speaking in foreign language)

91
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,143
We're all set.

92
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,938
(laughing)

93
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:48,021
(background chatter)

94
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,643
Somethin' tells me we're
gonna nail those guys.

95
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,476
Me too.

96
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,010
Where's your arm band?

97
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,883
I don't know.

98
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:08,412
Well a swell MP you turned out to be.

99
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:10,208
Here we are lookin' for a couple a guys

100
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,879
that 'll turn Paris upside down.

101
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,427
And you lose your armband.

102
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:14,972
Yeah, well where's yours?

103
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:16,643
Well what?

104
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,476
Say,

105
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:22,235
somethin' tells me we
almost had those guys.

106
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,068
Me too.

107
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:27,622
Come on soldier, we'll get 'em yet.

108
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:31,138
(speaking in foreign language)

109
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,366
Say now that ya brought that up,

110
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,810
I wanna ask you something.

111
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,727
(speaking in foreign language)

112
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,194
What did she say?

113
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,544
She said no.

114
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:46,132
Come on.

115
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:50,744
(speaking in foreign language)

116
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,827
(background chatter)

117
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:13,417
Boy.

118
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:17,158
Hey Tommy, I'm gettin' a
little tired a being an MP.

119
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:17,991
So am I.

120
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,914
These things are no good anyway.

121
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,467
Sometimes they make good handkerchiefs.

122
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,999
You know, MP, mop perspiration.

123
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,461
Oh you're off again.

124
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:27,890
(laughing)

125
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,092
Gilbert, what about promoting ourselves?

126
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:31,273
Splendid idea.

127
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:32,863
Lets be Lieutenants.

128
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,124
Just the thing.

129
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:37,304
After what we saw, we deserve it.

130
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:38,203
Tommy.

131
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:39,102
Yeah.

132
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:40,122
How would you like to be a general.

133
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:43,224
Not me, there's no chance for promotion.

134
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:44,122
Mmm.

135
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:45,387
Here we are.

136
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:49,180
Isn't it wonderful, the
future one has in the army?

137
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,284
Yeah.

138
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:52,535
You start at the bottom
and go over the top.

139
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:54,007
Now where are my Lieutenants?

140
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:58,212
Here they are, now stand
still boy, stand still.

141
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,712
Now there's a rank, and thank very ranked.

142
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,430
How do you do?

143
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,763
How do you do?

144
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,426
They won't give us the tumble,

145
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:20,982
they must be big game.

146
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:22,902
They may be big game to some people,

147
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,942
but they're just animal crackers to me.

148
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,816
Well now Gilbert, you can't tell.

149
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:29,062
Maybe they don't wanna
be seen with Lieutenants.

150
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:31,815
Alright then we'll be captains.

151
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:34,898
(background chatter)

152
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,714
You know Gilbert,

153
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:45,918
those girls show very good sense.

154
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,961
They don't like second Lieutenants.

155
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,619
Alright, you stand
still then shaved tail

156
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:52,330
while I make you a captain.

157
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,128
You won't make me a captain.

158
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:55,757
You'll make me a Major.

159
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:58,167
You know the higher we go,
the harder they'll fall.

160
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,941
A major, certainly,
where do I keep my majors?

161
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,941
Ah here they are, major.

162
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,916
Nope, those are rear admirals.

163
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,687
Here's the majors.

164
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:11,812
Now, as Adam said to Eve,

165
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,479
pick yourself a couple a leaves.

166
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:17,975
Say Gilbert,

167
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,203
if that little dark one don't
go for this, she ain't human.

168
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:22,508
(chuckles)

169
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,019
I've got a sneakin' idea,

170
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:26,628
that the one in the
floppy hat likes aviators.

171
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:30,502
Huh, great, we'll
make a few fly remarks.

172
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,458
Ha, splendid, splendid Major.

173
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,165
Would you like some decorations?

174
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,879
Well look now, nothing tantalizing,

175
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,160
just a DFC and a Quantic Air.

176
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,854
A DFC and a Quantic
Air, certainly, certainly.

177
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:41,956
Hold still.

178
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,225
There.

179
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:46,131
Boy, you look like a million dollars.

180
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:48,249
I may look like a million dollars,

181
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:51,582
but I'm going to be much easier to make.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,833
Beaver.

183
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,373
(background chatter)

184
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,994
(speaking in foreign language)

185
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,240
And all that sort of jolly nonsense.

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,806
I can't recall your name
but I've forgotten your face.

187
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,150
My my my,

188
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,779
that hat certainly has
marvelous wing spread.

189
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,963
I, uh, I bet you take off easily.

190
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:29,761
Major, have you noticed that

191
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,756
the large picture hats are coming back?

192
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,692
Yes, yes,

193
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:36,153
you know bit by bit our women
are losing their manhood.

194
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:37,995
Yes, I've noticed that.

195
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:40,194
I'll bet the face beneath
the brim is just as lovely

196
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:41,664
as the decoration.

197
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:44,331
And what decorations, ah lovely.

198
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,073
Mmm.

199
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:51,290
If we only had a little cream and sugar.

200
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,123
Major,

201
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,247
would you have an apple?

202
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:56,914
Thank you captain.

203
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm glad watermelons are not in season.

204
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,789
Bon jor.

205
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,418
Misuer, you are making a bad mistake.

206
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:08,540
You may be bad but you're no mistake.

207
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,891
(laughing)

208
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:11,603
Well put Captain.

209
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,399
You are very groll misuer.

210
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,928
Oh yes yes, I just groll
around from place to place.

211
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:17,400
(laughing)

212
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,561
Oh doesn't he say the cutest things?

213
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:20,867
Oh dear oh dear.

214
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:23,472
Lovely war we're having.

215
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:27,389
(speaking in foreign language)

216
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:32,825
Ha, well you certainly
cleaned that one up.

217
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,742
(speaking in foreign language)

218
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,602
Mmm what you say I like very much.

219
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:49,238
Oh I wonder what I said.

220
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:51,398
(laughing)

221
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:53,477
You are distinguish aviator?

222
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:55,637
Well, I don't think so,

223
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:59,550
but then, what's my opinion
compared to thousands of others?

224
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,025
Move over will ya honey?

225
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:01,858
Thank you.

226
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:04,578
Do you kiss soldiers?

227
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,859
Ah, that is my business.

228
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,276
How's business?

229
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:13,271
Misuer, why do you take up aviation?

230
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,106
Oh let me see, why did I take up avi-

231
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,456
oh I have it now, yeah.

232
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:18,248
They told me I was no good on earth.

233
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:20,498
(laughing)

234
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:22,696
Noon tomorrow,

235
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:24,902
tomorrow I'm going to
make a parachute leap.

236
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:25,965
Oh a parachute leap?

237
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:27,313
Yeah.

238
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,680
I wanna show General
Pershing what's in me.

239
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,930
(laughing)

240
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,038
Ex nay, ex nay.

241
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,123
Yes yes, you know I'm
very fond of France,

242
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,509
I love dear old France.

243
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,776
You know what I like about France?

244
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:47,696
I love to hear the French
peasants singing the mayonnaise.

245
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,326
♫ The camels are coming astray astray

246
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:50,876
♫ The camels are coming astray astray ♫

247
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:53,535
There's a little scotch in the major.

248
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:55,863
A little ginger ale too.

249
00:12:55,863 --> 00:13:00,474
(speaking in foreign language)

250
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,781
In the back nah nah.

251
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,681
In the back nah nah.

252
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,111
(laughing)

253
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:05,371
Nah nah nah.

254
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:06,538
Nah nah nah.

255
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,911
(talking over each other)

256
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:13,978
Just don't pay any
attention to the major.

257
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,939
He sometimes thinks he's a male dale.

258
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,445
Take a peek, take a peek.

259
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,362
My mistake, Pekinese.

260
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,450
As I was relating, when
I arrived in Paris,

261
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,750
little did I realize, what this
moment held in store for me.

262
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
But now I know.

263
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,628
Yes, now I know.

264
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:40,878
Well fellow.

265
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:51,951
It's alright Major, you can come up.

266
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,591
(laughing)

267
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:57,666
My goodness, the Major has been promoted.

268
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,299
He is now a Brigadier General.

269
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,092
Ah ladies, pardon me ladies.

270
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:04,396
May I introduce, Major
Operation of the Hospital Corps?

271
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:05,229
Major.

272
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,277
And I ladies,

273
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,435
I am Colonel Simkins.

274
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,071
Colonel Simkins?

275
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,147
Uh, Captain Simkins.

276
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,647
I can understand your mistake.

277
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:19,695
You know if those two
birds wasn't officers,

278
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:22,023
I'd think they were the guys we're after.

279
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,328
Officers or no officers,

280
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,406
I still think they're
the guys we're after.

281
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,239
Me too.

282
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:28,549
Can you keep a secret?

283
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:29,735
If she helps ya?

284
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,123
Oh sure.

285
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:32,268
Well, we're in the secret service.

286
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,285
Yes?

287
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:34,794
Yes, you see there so many spies around.

288
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,686
You know, German spies, Austrian spies,

289
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:39,152
Bulgarian spies.

290
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:40,335
And Eskimo spies.

291
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:41,641
(laughing)

292
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,514
Comical console, very comical.

293
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:46,659
Oh do you know Colonel Marshal?

294
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,005
Oh, do we know Colonel Marshal?

295
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:49,472
He's a pill.

296
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,353
Do you know that Colonel
Marshal thinks so much of us,

297
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:52,576
that he gives our photographs

298
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,336
to every soldier under his command?

299
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:55,479
Really?

300
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,992
Especially the MP's.

301
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:58,621
Yeah.

302
00:14:58,621 --> 00:14:59,887
Well he's a very good friend of mine.

303
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:01,847
He comes here to this
restaurant every day.

304
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:02,702
Here?

305
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,535
Yes.

306
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,368
Well well.

307
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,010
Well, so long girls.

308
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,502
We'll see you around girls.

309
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:10,415
Oh but must you really go so soon?

310
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:12,124
Yes, you see, waterman
is drilling a new ink well

311
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:13,555
and we've got to look it over.

312
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:16,638
(background chatter)

313
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:18,801
Hey.

314
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:22,781
Hey.

315
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:23,640
Did you hear that hey?

316
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,534
Hey, hey.

317
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,783
Hey get to the
Quartermaster's apartment.

318
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,616
Hey.

319
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,641
How dare you interfere
with officers in exercise.

320
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,867
Well we wasn't sure whether-

321
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:43,969
- Did you hear that Major?

322
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:46,043
He wasn't sure.

323
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,839
Oh, me oh my oh my oh my.

324
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,210
Not to be sure is the
greatest offense in the Army.

325
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,309
Yeah.

326
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:52,695
Let the punishment fit the crime.

327
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:54,450
I must think Major, I must think.

328
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,045
Don't strain yourself now Captain.

329
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:58,166
Oh I hate to be in such a state.

330
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,502
You know my nasty nerves.

331
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,419
Let me see.

332
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:03,627
What will I do?

333
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:05,520
Ah ha.

334
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,728
(background chatter)

335
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,066
I'll be an hour, get yours.

336
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:24,899
Yes sir.

337
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,149
Colonel Marshal.

338
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,107
Oh hello Olga.

339
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:31,616
Strange that I always meet you here.

340
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,458
Always I'm here waiting for you

341
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,537
to be nice to me.

342
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,459
I can't be nice, I'm married.

343
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,598
Oh but can't you be just
a little bit nice sir?

344
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:43,005
Now Olga, I don't wanna be rude,

345
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,374
but if I am nice, you send
me perfume love letters

346
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,601
that can ruin me.

347
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,396
You've got to stop it you understand?

348
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:50,600
And what's more, what do you
mean by sending your love notes

349
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,090
in a piece of United
States Army envelopes?

350
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,968
Because, if I do not send them

351
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:57,415
in official United States Army envelopes,

352
00:16:57,415 --> 00:17:00,188
you do not open my letters.

353
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,309
Yes, but don't you know
that's a serious offense?

354
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,374
What?

355
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,883
Not opening my letters?

356
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:07,533
No no, sending them
in official envelopes.

357
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:11,124
Oh, but can I help it
that you are so magnificent?

358
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:14,124
Oh mon brav, do not scold poor Olga.

359
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,486
You are always so cold.

360
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:20,628
Hot or cold, you've got to
stop sending those letters.

361
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:25,238
(speaking in foreign language)

362
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:26,217
They are so snappy.

363
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:27,217
So handsome.

364
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:31,114
Well of course when it comes to that,

365
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,626
you know these military men.

366
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:35,075
(speaking in foreign language)

367
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:36,789
Take me to luncheon.

368
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,173
I can't take you to luncheon.

369
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:39,564
Why not?

370
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:40,706
My wife is waiting for me.

371
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,374
You might introduce me to your wife?

372
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:44,707
Yes, I might, but I won't.

373
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,568
See you later.

374
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,558
Well we had 'em again.

375
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:51,391
Yeah.

376
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:53,942
Hey listen,

377
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,245
when I do get hold of 'em,

378
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:58,510
I'm gonna knock 'em so cold
they'll keep for years.

379
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,343
Me too.

380
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:05,296
Hey.

381
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:16,221
Hey.

382
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,004
Lemme go, lemme go or
I'll bust you in the face.

383
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,587
You'll bust who in what face?

384
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:39,897
Oh.

385
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:41,694
Then there is a Santy Clause.

386
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:43,080
Back up soldier.

387
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,670
What outfit.

388
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,917
Detail of 2 AWOL.

389
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,242
Well you better not let my dad catch ya.

390
00:18:49,242 --> 00:18:50,592
Ah.

391
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:51,732
Who's your dad?

392
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:52,834
Colonel Marshal.

393
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:53,693
Are ya sure?

394
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,916
What?

395
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,224
I mean uh,

396
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,365

397
00:18:57,365 --> 00:18:58,466
I mean, you know,

398
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,216
you flatter him.

399
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:02,864
Oh, have you ever met my dad?

400
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:04,022
No but,

401
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:05,939
he's tryin' to meet me.

402
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:08,112
I'll fix it.

403
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:11,197
No no don't do me any favors.

404
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:12,593
Whew.

405
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,694
Say,

406
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,001
you know when I first saw you,

407
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,365
I thought you were a little French girl.

408
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,473
Honest?

409
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:19,733
Yeah.

410
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,531
Hot dog, that's my repressed desire.

411
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:22,364
Say.

412
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:23,655
What?

413
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:26,523
Do you think I could fascinate him?

414
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:28,033
Fascinate him?

415
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,888
Honey, you could mutilate him.

416
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:35,538
(speaking in foreign language)

417
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,436
They're so handsome, so snappy, oh.

418
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:39,269
Oh.

419
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,864
It's a good thing I've been vaccinated.

420
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:47,003
Say honey,

421
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:49,449
I wanna ask you something that
might sound a little personal

422
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,807
you know at first.

423
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:51,703
What is it?

424
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:53,384
Do ya love me?

425
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:54,771
Well.

426
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,853
You'll have to give me a little time.

427
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:59,466
Well you better make up
your mind, it's 2:30 now.

428
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,872
You know this Paris is a fast place.

429
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:05,878
Gee, isn't Paris a
grand place to live in?

430
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:07,756
Do you, do you live in Paris?

431
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:08,589
Uh huh.

432
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:12,172
Then Paris is a grand place to live in.

433
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,601
Say.

434
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:14,743
What?

435
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:16,863
Are you married?

436
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:19,468
No I just naturally look worried.

437
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,777
Oh I think it's a shame
to send cute little fellas

438
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,862
like you to the front.

439
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,615
That's what I said but,

440
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:29,272
ya can't tell these generals anything.

441
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:33,023
I think it's wonderful, us
happening to meet this way.

442
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,815
Gee, an I think it's
wonderful to meet a girl,

443
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:38,771
who's beautiful enough to be dumb

444
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,565
and doesn't take advantage of it.

445
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:42,650
(whistle)

446
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,317
(playful music)

447
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,508
♫ When you are on duty

448
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,996
♫ Watching all around

449
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:58,163
♫ I can hear you passing by my door

00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:24,957
Say how old are you?

470
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,060
Sixteen.

471
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,239
Oh no, you couldn't learn
that in sixteen years.

472
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,906
(playful music)

473
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:41,237
Lady will ya drive to the right,

474
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:42,459

475
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,929
Oh misuer did I hurt you?

476
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,095
Well you bent my bumper
a little bit, yeah.

477
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:48,255
Oh you have anything with aviator?

478
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:50,698
Yes and I'm just in the
midst of a nonstop flight.

479
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:51,883
Oh but,

480
00:23:51,883 --> 00:23:53,084
(speaking in foreign language)

481
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:56,584
We'll take that up a little later honey.

482
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:09,416
Hey, that's the Colonel's car.

483
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,581
There they go again, hey.

484
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:13,886
Who's driving it?

485
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,155
One of them AWOL's sir.

486
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,753
Get that man or I'll
put you back in the ranks.

487
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:17,674
Get me a car.

488
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:18,507
Who's car sir?

489
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,340
Anybody's car.

490
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,364

00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:21,348

Get the Colonel a car.

494
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:24,371
Get the Colonel a car.

495
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:25,635
Get the Colonel a car.

496
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:27,143
Get the Colonel a car.

497
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:29,507
Ah mon brav, at last we are together.

498
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:31,178
You may be together, but I'm not.

499
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,845
Get the Colonel a, get me a car.

500
00:24:34,814 --> 00:24:37,481
(playful music)

501
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,137
(car backfires)

502
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:57,976
(playful music)

503
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:07,630
Well well, another air disaster.

504
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,297
(playful music)

505
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,642
The camels are still coming.

506
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:20,702
Well I didn't realize what
a pickup this car had.

507
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:21,845
Say,

508
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:24,172
isn't there any place where you ain't?

509
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:27,197
Snap out of it, the MP's are on us.

510
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:28,792
Oh geeze.

511
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,485
You know those MP's are
doing everything they can

512
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:34,318
to make this war miserable for me.

513
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:37,199
Listen honey,

514
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,587
if anything should happen

515
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:39,860
and we're separated,

516
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,570
you meet me here tonight at eight o'clock.

517
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,408
Oh are you looking for trouble?

518
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,445
Huh, I don't have to look for it,

519
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:48,100
Gilbert is always with me.

520
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,510
Missin' our song.

521
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,001
Isn't that pretty?

522
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,087
♫ When you get blue

523
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:58,839
♫ Just whistle for me dear

524
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,006
♫ I'll promise you I
will never fail to hear

525
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:08,639
♫ Then I'll pretend
it's just a little bird

526
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:14,806
♫ I'll find my sweetie
without another word

527
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,067
♫ When in the shade dear someone you see

528
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:25,017
♫ Don't be afraid dear for

529
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,651
♫ It'll be

530
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:30,672
♫ Little me

531
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,839
♫ We'll cuddle close
until the break of day

532
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:40,430
♫ Whistling the blues away ♫

533
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:49,953
(romantic music)

534
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:01,641
What are you sittin' on the ground for?

535
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:06,126
'Cause it happen to
be there when I landed.

536
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:07,844
How did you get in the Colonel's car?

537
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:10,375
I belong in it, I'm his daughter.

538
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,066
I remember now, I've seen you with him.

539
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,779
Gee I'm glad you came.

540
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,452
Say I'm after those guys,

541
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:18,531
they make love to every girl they see.

542
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,634
The little one?

543
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:20,816
He's the worst.

544
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,036
Oh he is is he?

545
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,868
I'll fix him, what's his name?

546
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,372
Don't you know?

547
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,024
Well, we were so busy,
I forgot to find out.

548
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:30,984
Tommy Turner, and the
skinny one is Gilbert Simkins.

549
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:34,624
AWOL, impersonatin'
officers and foolin' women.

550
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:35,927
Foolin' girls?

551
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:37,516
Yes and laughin' at 'em.

552
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,638
Foolin' girls an laughin' at 'em huh?

553
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:40,946
I'll get 'em for ya.

554
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:41,884
How?

555
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:44,049
Well, he told me to meet him,

556
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:46,292
never mind, this is my big moment.

557
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,575
I'll capture 'em both, single handed.

558
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:50,575
Say, you're pretty clever ain't ya?

559
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:52,326
Sure I'm clever.

560
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:55,227
Say, maybe you're my big romance.

561
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:56,060
Ma'am.

562
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:59,471
Well I mean, is it
against Army regulations

563
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,324
for a Colonel's daughter to
get a yen for a Sergeant?

564
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,115
Well I don't know, I mean.

565
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:05,134
Oh

566
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:07,335
(speaking in foreign language)

567
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:10,440
They are so handsome, so snappy.

568
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,273
Be nice to me big boy.

569
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:15,421
(sirens)

570
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,276
What were you doing in that trunk,

571
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,734
with a private?

572
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,722
Well, those two fellas were
tryin' to run away with me.

573
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:42,251
But, I surrounded 'em.

574
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:45,069
Well I shot at 'em and missed but,

575
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,513
don't worry pops, I'll get 'em for ya yet.

576
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:49,146
My little baby.

577
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:51,646
Just a chip off the ole block.

578
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,815
Colonel Marshal's not there huh?

579
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:05,755
Alright thank you.

580
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:07,632
Can't you telephone anyone else?

581
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:09,957
Well we've tried everywhere.

582
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:12,289
Oh perhaps he went to
Pier's and missed you.

583
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:16,039
No matter where he
went, he didn't miss me.

584
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:19,231
For Colonel Marshal sir.

585
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,750
Uh, not here, I'll take it.

586
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:35,863
Ohh, what a delightful odor.

587
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:39,598
Uh, yes, that's the new one.

588
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:41,842
Spring time of love.

589
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,349
You know these french, you can't beat 'em

590
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,024
when it comes to perfume.

591
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:47,065
Gee what an odd idea.

592
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:49,392
Sending Army orders on perfume paper.

593
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:50,330
Yes.

594
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,344
Uh no no no, no not at all.

595
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:56,930
You see, in this way we can
classify them immediately.

596
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,347
Now for instance,

597
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,585
now this would be from the
Quartermaster's department.

598
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:03,052
Oh.

599
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:05,948
Well, if that is from the
Quartermaster's department,

600
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:08,480
I imagine it will be simply glorious

601
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,421
to smell an order from
General Headquarters.

602
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:14,754
Ha, yes, ha ha I never thought a that.

603
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:25,795
Ah.

604
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:28,428
It is no coincidence we meet again.

605
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,631
Didn't I tell you to
keep away from here?

606
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,919
Don't be mad pops, introduce me.

607
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:34,674
I haven't got time.

608
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:36,509
Delighted to meet a friend of pops.

609
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,307
(speaking in foreign language)

610
00:31:38,307 --> 00:31:39,243
Annette I'm in a hurry.

611
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:40,303
Okay pops,

612
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:42,876
run along, I might pick up a few pointers

613
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:44,262
from this baby.

614
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:45,850
She's the type.

615
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,517
(clears throat)

616
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:04,859
Snap out of it.

617
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,738
Has this whole blame family gone crazy?

618
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:09,224
Dealing and cooing like a pair
of nit witted twittle dums

619
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:10,245
right in front of that gate?

620
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,674
What are you doing here?

621
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:13,506
Seven days leave sir.

622
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:15,097
Well you can spend them
all away from my daughter.

623
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:16,111
Oh don't be violent dad.

624
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,416
Jim wants to marry me.

625
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,475
Oh he does aye?

626
00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:19,494
A man who takes on a wife and a war

627
00:32:19,494 --> 00:32:21,092
at the same time is insane.

628
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:21,925
Clear out.

629
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:23,750
Yes sir.

630
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,527
Oh father.

631
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:29,954
Why do you hate Jim?

632
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:32,159
Because he wants to
take you away from me.

633
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,195
I went to a lot of
trouble to get my family.

634
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:35,953
I married your mother didn't I?

635
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,317
Well I decided that you
shouldn't marry a soldier.

636
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,484
You said it.

637
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,514
Can't you look after your family,

638
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:44,228
I've got a war on my hands.

639
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,270
Yes I just saw one of your orders

640
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,510
from the Quartermaster's Department.

641
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,179
Spring time of love.

642
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,429
(grunting)

643
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:56,440
When a man kisses you,

644
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,724
does that mean he's
really in love with you?

645
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:00,073
Men kisses?

646
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:02,195
No one can tell nothing by those.

647
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:03,747
Say,

648
00:33:03,747 --> 00:33:05,419
do you know anything in particular

649
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,337
about men with curly hair?

650
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:09,460
Curly hair, straight hair, no hair,

651
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,578
they're all the same.

652
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:13,788
Suppose you fell in love with a fella,

653
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:15,465
that loved every girl he met.

654
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:17,297
What would you do?

655
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:19,907
Make believe I love him desperately.

656
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,376
Never cease to say,

657
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,029
(speaking in foreign language)

658
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:27,945
Write him letters, two
three six, every day.

659
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:31,375
Aw gee, I had a lotta
trouble with my big moment.

660
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,208
He's AWOL.

661
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,424
(speaking in foreign language)

662
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:35,533
AWOL?

663
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,166
A whale of a liar.

664
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,451
Oh, but you will win him.

665
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,796
There are many ways.

666
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:41,896
Have you ever tried perfume?

667
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,164
Perfume?

668
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:44,795
Mmm, there's one in particular,

669
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:46,790
(speaking in foreign language)

670
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,320
in english it is called,
spring time of love.

671
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,403
1000 francs to bottle,

672
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:52,750
why don't you try some?

673
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,017
I will.

674
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:58,542
I'm gonna get revenge if
I have to get it perfumed.

675
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:01,561
Oh ma, come on over an meet
what they go for in Paris.

676
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:02,835
Sorry I'm in a hurry.

677
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,715
Aw but she's one of pops girlfriends.

678
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:07,182
Annette, don't be
silly, that's not funny.

679
00:34:07,182 --> 00:34:08,914
Come along you've said enough.

680
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:12,028
Oh mom, can I have a thousand
francs to buy some perfume?

681
00:34:12,028 --> 00:34:13,454
What sort of perfume?

682
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:14,840
Oh it's a wow,

683
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,597
it lures men.

684
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,109
What?

685
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:20,436
Well she uses it.

686
00:34:20,436 --> 00:34:23,372
They call it spring time of love.

687
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:25,943
Spring time of love eh?

688
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:28,610
She'll be lucky if winter comes.

689
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:40,326
Gee,

690
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,944
you know after all Gilbert,

691
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:47,027
love is peace, quiet and tranquility.

692
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:51,303
That isn't love, that's sleep.

693
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:55,123
Do you really think that gaga
Annette is gonna show up?

694
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:56,873
Say she isn't gaga.

695
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:01,088
She has eyes like the heavens.

696
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:03,663
Cheeks like peaches of picarding.

697
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:05,580
Oh isn't that pretty.

698
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:11,049
Is that them?

699
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:13,382
Shh, you'll scare 'em off.

700
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:16,314
Here's my gun miss.

701
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,702
And remember, we get 500
for 'em, dead or alive.

702
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,659
You sure they're the right guys though?

703
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:22,742
Tommy Turner,

704
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:27,340
curly hair, Gilbert Simkins, skinny,

705
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,057
wears horn rimmed glasses.

706
00:35:29,057 --> 00:35:31,176
Wait for me at the palae,

707
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:33,808
I'll deliver the bodies FOB.

708
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:35,641
See ya at the palae.

709
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:02,523
(playful music)

710
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:16,679
Hello boys.

711
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,512
Oh gee honey, I knew you'd come.

712
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:25,118
Ah, I seem to feel the
call of the great outdoors.

713
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:26,504
Is this your car?

714
00:36:26,504 --> 00:36:28,950
Yeah we picked it up
for practically nothing.

715
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,281
Yeah, everything about it makes a noise

716
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:32,950
except the horn.

717
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,343
Ah,

718
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:36,422
horned rim glasses.

719
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:38,672
The description is perfect.

720
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:42,465
He he, she's not as
gaga as I thought she was.

721
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:43,548
Curly hair.

722
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:45,628
Gee I'm lucky.

723
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:47,752
Kiss me.

724
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:51,563
Huh, just as I expected, now you,

725
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,025
watch my method.

726
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:54,191
(clears throat)

727
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:56,275
What makes you think
you're so lucky honey?

728
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:58,885
Because I've got you.

729
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,984
Ha ha ha, boy I kill 'em, I kill 'em.

730
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:04,148
Does that really make so
much difference to you?

731
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:06,714
It means that I'll make
500 dollars out of ya.

732
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:08,389
Outta him?

733
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,554
You must expect to know him a long time.

734
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:13,859
No from both of ya, I'll
make 500 dollars tonight.

735
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,122
From both of us?

736
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:16,716
You're in Paris now boy.

737
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:18,514
You two boys are AWOL an I'm gonna

738
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:20,964
take ya back to my
father, Colonel Marshal.

739
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:21,797
What's that?

740
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:23,302
Hey hey hey wait a
minute, wait a minute,

741
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,611
wait, let's get this thing straight.

742
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:26,032
You've got it.

743
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:27,657
Do you mean to tell
me that you'd turn me in

744
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:30,310
after I've decided to let
you fall in love with me?

745
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,508
Fall in love with you,

746
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:34,719
why it's me that she cares for.

747
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,765
This for you.

748
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,809
And that for you.

749
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,417
And this for your papa.

750
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:44,334
Papa gets the best of everything.

751
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:46,960
Um,

752
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,574
honey would you pardon us a moment?

753
00:37:49,574 --> 00:37:51,251
Yes just one little moment.

754
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:53,251
Oh no, stick around soldiers.

755
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,293
Uh we won't be long, we won't be long.

756
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:56,432
Just a short conference.

757
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:58,145
Come back.

758
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,062
(nervous laughing)

759
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:04,514
She wants us to come back.

760
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:07,654
Odd how one will
misunderstand a thing isn't it?

761
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:09,207
Mm hmm.

762
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:11,780
Uh, would you mind putting that down,

763
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,165
you're embarrassing us.

764
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,915
Yeah if it went off
we'd be terribly upset.

765
00:38:20,252 --> 00:38:22,514
You drive a car don't ya four eyes?

766
00:38:22,514 --> 00:38:24,556
Well after a fashion yes.

767
00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:26,681
Uh what he doesn't know about driving

768
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,026
would fill a hospital.

769
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:30,105
Get in there an drive.

770
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:32,023
She's takin' us for a ride.

771
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,063
Listen if you ever talk
fast in your life boy,

772
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,573
don't stutter now.

773
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:39,836
Get up there, you get
in the back seat with me.

774
00:38:39,836 --> 00:38:42,060
Oh, it just occurred to me

775
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,304
that I haven't a license for driving.

776
00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:46,129
So if you'll pardon me,
I'll just wander around.

777
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:47,379
Get in there.

778
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:55,408
Drive to the palae, I'm
taking you to my father.

779
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:57,991
Peace, quiet and tranquility.

780
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:08,456
Will ya have a lollipop?

781
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:10,789
No I don't like lollipops.

782
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:14,326
What are you doing with
these powder puffs?

783
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:17,746
Powder puffs, I've
been eatin' them all day,

784
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:19,419
I thought they were marshmallows.

785
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:21,952
Oh, will ya step on
it, will ya step on it?

786
00:39:21,952 --> 00:39:23,586
You're still in second gear.

787
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:25,628
What's he talking about?

788
00:39:25,628 --> 00:39:27,259
He wants me to make love to you

789
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:28,683
so you won't turn us in.

790
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:29,910
Oh is that it?

791
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,242
Well it's no use, not
after the way you let me

792
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:34,204
flop on the ground this afternoon.

793
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:37,878
You'll forgive me honey,
you've got such a big heart.

794
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:41,353
Detour, detour, the girl
didn't fall on her heart.

795
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:44,655
Ya know honey, when you put your hand

796
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:46,488
in my hair back there,

797
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:50,161
it just seemed to fill
me with electricity.

798
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,122
What, a little thing like that?

799
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:53,758
Oh don't do that.

800
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,091
But I like it.

801
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:59,757
Ha ha, well that's
in the bag, come Tommy,

802
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:00,859
we must away.

803
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,610
Get back there and drive.

804
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,613
Oh you want me to continue
driving, is that it?

805
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,530
Yes and drive slower.

806
00:40:07,592 --> 00:40:11,759
Would that you are birds
and I a humble shot gun.

807
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,536
Do ya think this is gonna work?

808
00:40:16,536 --> 00:40:19,035
Its a cinch, that's a smart little girl.

809
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:20,368
Leave it to her.

810
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:23,761
(horn honking)

811
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:25,432
You're makin' fun a me,

812
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:27,350
an just for that I'm gonna turn you two in

813
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,832
an get that 500 dollars.

814
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:31,374
Wait, I'll tell ya what to do.

815
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:34,591
Just turn him in an take 250.

816
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,264
They'll put him in the guard house.

817
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:37,896
Great.

818
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,979
That'll give us a chance to be alone.

819
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:45,998
Get back quick, don't let 'em see ya.

820
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:54,674
Well I'll be-

821
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:55,507
- Me too.

822
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,299
You're never satisfied.

823
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:18,325
Always complaining, you
don't seem to realize

824
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:19,158
the problems I have.

825
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:21,255
I don't see how they
could have a war without you

826
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:22,293
I know I couldn't.

827
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:23,644
Oh stop it.

828
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,557
You'd have the last word with a nickel.

829
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:26,699
Where's Eileen?

830
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:27,844
Oh she's with Jim.

831
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:30,331
There you are, I have
to attend to everything.

832
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:32,370
Can I be both father and mother?

833
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,699
I shouldn't be surprised,

834
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,532

00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,907

857
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:53,429
No sir, those two doors are the only way

858
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:54,775
they can come in or out.

859
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,523
(speaking in foreign language)

860
00:44:58,523 --> 00:44:59,440

00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,508
Waiter.

866
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,695
It's a Colonel.

867
00:45:23,695 --> 00:45:25,406

868
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:26,998

00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:49,595
Nice quiet dinner for two.

00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:51,186
No soup.

875
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:52,731

876
00:45:52,731 --> 00:45:53,916

don't tell me, don't tell me.

878
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:58,683
Is it vegetable, animal or mineral?

879
00:45:58,683 --> 00:45:59,683
Imbeciles.

880
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:03,002
I'm sorry but we're all out of those.

881
00:46:03,002 --> 00:46:05,902
Would you like some
naturalized Swiss cheese?

882
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:07,206
How's your turtle soup?

883
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:09,330

(speaking in foreign language)

886
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:14,673
Turtle soup, very snappy.

887
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:16,468
I think I'll have a young chicken.

888
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:19,445
It must be very young,
in fact extremely young.

889
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:22,695
Heh, maybe I better bring you an egg.

890
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:28,421
One premature chicken.

891
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:31,197
Have you a wild duck?

892
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:34,214
Ha ha, no but we can take a tame one out

893
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:35,353

894
00:46:35,353 --> 00:46:37,603
(laughing)

895
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,239
I'd like to have a nice juicy poultry

896
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,932
with dressing and brown gravy.

897
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,682
So would I ya know I'm starved.

898
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:51,338
Fried eggs, 200 francs.

899
00:46:51,338 --> 00:46:52,479
Yes.

900
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,277
Your eggs are very high.

901
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,726
Ah but you must remember that an egg is

902
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:59,625
a whole days work for a hen.

903
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,279
I think I'll have a
nice fresh artichoke.

904
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:04,728
He thinks he'll have
a nice fresh artichoke.

905
00:47:04,728 --> 00:47:07,262
He thinks he'll have
a nice fresh artichoke.

906
00:47:07,262 --> 00:47:10,645
Now let me see, what will I have next?

907
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:12,110
Indigestion I guess.

908
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,109
(laughing)

909
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:15,785
Would you like some nice,

910
00:47:15,785 --> 00:47:17,701
petit marite?

911
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,777
Petit mon, how do you spell it?

912
00:47:19,777 --> 00:47:20,610
Oh um,

913
00:47:21,731 --> 00:47:23,449
I'll bring you a cup a coffee.

914
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:24,532
And listen,

915
00:47:25,485 --> 00:47:28,508
don't ask him if he has frogs legs.

916
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:30,795
How dare you talk,
that'll be all, hurry.

917
00:47:30,795 --> 00:47:32,878
Yes sir, we'll do that.

918
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:35,763
I'm awfully pleased to have met you.

919
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:37,513
Where's your polly?

920
00:47:44,952 --> 00:47:48,392
Come on soldier, let's look upstairs.

921
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:50,961
(background chatter)

922
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:53,864
I'll bet he comes
back with a cream puff.

923
00:47:53,864 --> 00:47:54,697
Gaston.

924
00:47:56,227 --> 00:47:58,795
Coming right up madam, coming right up.

927
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,493
I'm glad you think so.

928
00:48:05,493 --> 00:48:07,997
How is it you are here?

929
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:09,329
Secret service.

930
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:11,294
Oh is that why you
wait on Colonel Marshal?

931
00:48:11,294 --> 00:48:12,581
I beg your pardon?

932
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:13,455
Colonel Marshal.

933
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:15,294
He's at the table you wait on.

934
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:16,461
Oh so it is.

935
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:21,619
The dear old Colonel,
looking well too isn't he?

936
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:30,963
(laughing)

937
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:47,383
What a man, what a man.

938
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:50,621
(laughing)

939
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,812
(laughing)

940
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,833
I'm sorry, we're all out of soup.

941
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,344
Of all the idiots,

942
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:05,565
bring me some food.

943
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:06,830
Oh you want food?

944
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,894
Of course.

945
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:10,463
Ha ha, ya know I knew
there was something.

946
00:49:10,463 --> 00:49:12,947
(laughing)

947
00:49:12,947 --> 00:49:13,780
Waiter.

948
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:18,285
My cocoa is cold.

949
00:49:19,808 --> 00:49:21,808
I said my cocoa is cold.

950
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:25,686
(laughing)

951
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:32,380
Everything all right sir?

952
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,425
No, everything's all wrong.

953
00:49:34,425 --> 00:49:36,061
The trouble with this place is,

954
00:49:36,061 --> 00:49:37,649
you, you have no decorum.

955
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:38,958
Oh we have it, we have it.

956
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,265
But it isn't very fresh.

957
00:49:40,265 --> 00:49:41,765
What's that sir?

958
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:52,907
(dishes clattering)

959
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:00,743
Tommy.

960
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:03,685
Pardon me.

961
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:09,141
I just got a tip that that
old fellow is Colonel Marshal.

962
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:10,447
Ya better find out for sure.

963
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:11,864
Leave it to me.

964
00:50:13,752 --> 00:50:15,226
Pardon me sir.

965
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:17,719
But are you a relative of Colonel Marshal?

966
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,434
Why I am Colonel Marshal.

967
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:22,434
Ah, that explains the resemblance.

968
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,343
It's Colonel Marshal all right.

969
00:50:43,655 --> 00:50:47,238
Oh, you want the Colonel
to have this note?

970
00:50:48,094 --> 00:50:49,891
Colonel, note from the
young lady across the way.

971
00:50:49,891 --> 00:50:51,015
Now don't give it a thought,

972
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:51,965
don't give it a thought,

973
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,382
always glad to be of service.

974
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,102
Dear Snuggle puff,

975
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,550
who is the old froth that's with you

976
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,138
and where-

977
00:51:04,138 --> 00:51:05,484
I can't make out that word.

978
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:06,545
Why how dare you.

979
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:08,385
Well what is it, what is it?

980
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:11,241
Why it's a message from
the military police sergeant.

981
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:13,637
Reporting on two desperate
men absent without leave.

982
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,902
(laughing)

983
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:15,962
What a liar.

984
00:51:15,962 --> 00:51:17,105
Why how dare you.

985
00:51:17,105 --> 00:51:18,402
You have such a thing.

986
00:51:18,402 --> 00:51:19,788
And you sir,

987
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:21,541
why aren't you in the army?

988
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:23,457
That's a long story Colonel.

989
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:25,085
Ya see it's this way.

990
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,085
Its my feet.

991
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:28,929
Well what's the matter with them?

992
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:29,947
Flat?

993
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:30,780
Cold.

994
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:38,189
I can't eat this duck.

995
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:39,538
Send for the manager.

996
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:41,618
It's no use, he won't eat it either.

997
00:51:41,618 --> 00:51:43,125
Here, you might try it.

998
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:43,958
Huh?

999
00:51:45,496 --> 00:51:46,329
Gaston.

1000
00:51:47,297 --> 00:51:49,380
Coming up like a storm.

1001
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:52,523
Will you give me a serviette please?

1002
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:54,773
Serviette, certain e moi.

1003
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,580
(whistles)

1004
00:52:03,863 --> 00:52:05,761
I'd like a serviette.

1005
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:07,277
A serviette?

1006
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:08,834

(dishes clattering)

1008
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:14,267
That's enough.

1009
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:16,105
You should be discharged.

1010
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:19,323
(speaking in foreign language)

1011
00:52:19,323 --> 00:52:21,728
I can't speak French.

1012
00:52:21,728 --> 00:52:25,645
I want the proprietor,
where is the proprietor?

1013
00:52:30,298 --> 00:52:32,503
I am se proprietor misuer.

1014
00:52:32,503 --> 00:52:34,179
Anything I can do for you?

1015
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:35,686
Do you speak French?

1016
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,029
We we.

1017
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,639
I want this man discharged.

1018
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,284
(speaking in foreign language)

1019
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,722
Then you're fired.

1020
00:52:43,722 --> 00:52:46,325
(speaking in foreign language)

1021
00:52:46,325 --> 00:52:49,834
(talking over each other)

1022
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:53,261
(speaking in foreign language)

1023
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:57,178
(speaking in foreign language)

1024
00:53:16,055 --> 00:53:18,916
(phone ringing)

1025
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,099
Colonel Marshal's office.

1026
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:20,955
Yes sir.

1027
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:23,036
Oh General Hale for you sir.

1028
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:25,478
Yes General, I've
just been advised by D2

1029
00:53:25,478 --> 00:53:27,434
your plans are on the way over.

1030
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:29,428
Well what the goose is delaying them?

1031
00:53:29,428 --> 00:53:30,570
For Colonel Marshal sir.

1032
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,321
A just a minute General,
here's something now.

1033
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:34,645
Spring time of love.

1034
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,725
I'm very sorry General, yes sir,

1035
00:53:36,725 --> 00:53:38,475
it is something else.

1036
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:42,025
Oh hangin' all, I can't
hang on this phone all day.

1037
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:43,821
You get those plans for me.

1038
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:47,620
And remember I am holding you
strictly accountable for them.

1039
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,453
Yes sir.

1040
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:50,387
Colonel Marshal sir.

1041
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:52,784
A just a minute General,
here's another message.

1042
00:53:52,784 --> 00:53:56,034
Oh get those plans and get 'em quick.

1043
00:53:58,954 --> 00:54:02,527
Before you give it to me, smell it.

1044
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:04,011
Tobacco.

1045
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:05,479
Here they are at last.

1046
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:06,907
Get General Hale on the phone

1047
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:08,088
and tell him I'm sending them through.

1048
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:09,598
And who would be able to carry them sir?

1049
00:54:09,598 --> 00:54:10,660
Lieutenant James Reed.

1050
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,416
Locate my daughter and you'll find him.

1051
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,209
Order an escort to
prepare to leave at once.

1052
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,042
Yes sir.

1053
00:54:21,555 --> 00:54:23,388
Lieutenant Reed sir.

1054
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,868
You sent for me sir.

1055
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:28,258
Yes Lieutenant, I've got a job for you.

1056
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:29,771
This has to go to General Hale

1057
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,400
as fast as a man can carry it.

1058
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,418
General Hale sir?

1059
00:54:32,418 --> 00:54:33,401
But he's at the front.

1060
00:54:33,401 --> 00:54:35,640
You'll have a car and
the best driver available.

1061
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,862
Well I'm on leave sir.

1062
00:54:36,862 --> 00:54:38,860
This is no detail
for a tin soldier Reed.

1063
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,329
Perhaps I've made a mistake.

1064
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:42,285
No mistake as far as I'm concerned sir.

1065
00:54:42,285 --> 00:54:43,225
What are the orders?

1066
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:44,330
You will leave immediately,

1067
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:46,570
Captain Jones will attend to
the details of your escort.

1068
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,403
Yes sir.

1069
00:55:11,097 --> 00:55:12,402
Hello big boy.

1070
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:14,361
What's on your mind?

1071
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:16,078
I came to say goodbye to Eileen.

1072
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:18,860
Well if you're wise, you'll
say goodbye to mom first.

1073
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,103
Say why did pops send for you?

1074
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:23,264
Oh he gave me some very important papers

1075
00:55:23,264 --> 00:55:24,942
to deliver to General Hale at the front.

1076
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:27,547
Oh yeah, well that's
sorta dangerous ain't it?

1077
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:29,748
Well it's not exactly a health resort.

1078
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:31,877
And if you deliver 'em,
it'll make you a hero?

1079
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:34,364
Oh yes, a great big hero.

1080
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,078
Ya know Jim I like you.

1081
00:55:36,078 --> 00:55:38,528
You have such an open faith.

1082
00:55:38,528 --> 00:55:41,665
Thanks, I think you'll be
very charming when you grow up.

1083
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:43,911
Oh you don't know the half of it.

1084
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:45,054
You're pretty clever aren't you?

1085
00:55:45,054 --> 00:55:46,737
Sure I'm clever, say,

1086
00:55:46,737 --> 00:55:49,627
maybe you're my big romance.

1087
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:50,891
What's that?

1088
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:52,854
Well I mean, uh,

1089
00:55:52,854 --> 00:55:54,314
is it against army regulations

1090
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:57,784
for a Colonel's daughter to
get a yearn for a Lieutenant?

1091
00:55:57,784 --> 00:55:59,008
What are you talking about?

1092
00:55:59,008 --> 00:56:00,479
Oh Jimbo,

1093
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:02,559
(speaking in foreign language)

1094
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,226
They are so snappy, so handsome.

1095
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:08,561
Me like me big boy.

1096
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:12,735
Say what are you tryin'
to do, flirt with me?

1097
00:56:12,735 --> 00:56:14,654
Sure I'm tryin' to flirt with ya.

1098
00:56:14,654 --> 00:56:16,124
Well look, I tell ya what you do,

1099
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:16,957
you meet me here.

1100
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,204
Yeah.

1101
00:56:18,204 --> 00:56:19,954
In about ten years.

1102
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,493
Hello.

1103
00:56:30,493 --> 00:56:31,415
Hi there babe.

1104
00:56:31,415 --> 00:56:32,638
Did you get that perfume?

1105
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:33,471
I'll say I did.

1106
00:56:33,471 --> 00:56:34,304
And it is good?

1107
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:35,653
Is it good, boy it's golden.

1108
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:39,200
But I got something much
more exciting than perfume.

1109
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,033
What is that?

1110
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:41,606
Papers, important ones.

1111
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:42,913
I stole 'em from Jim.

1112
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:43,891
Does Jim know this?

1113
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:44,915
Certainly not.

1114
00:56:44,915 --> 00:56:47,040
But I've got to get these
papers started to the front

1115
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,348
before he finds out they're gone.

1116
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:49,940
And you think you can do it?

1117
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,459
Sure, if you'll help me.

1118
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:54,992
Now listen, my boyfriend will
do anything I tell him to.

1119
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:57,119
But his buddy is a hard nut, got me?

1120
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,728
The buddy with the
goggles, he is for me.

1121
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:00,585
Great.

1122
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:01,970
Now you work on him, and we'll get 'em

1123
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:02,989
both back to the front

1124
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,699
and these papers go with them.

1125
00:57:04,699 --> 00:57:06,622
I will convince Gilbert.

1126
00:57:06,622 --> 00:57:08,955
And I will convince Tommy.

1127
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:12,023
Somebody paging me?

1128
00:57:12,023 --> 00:57:13,245
My angel.

1129
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:14,919
My sugar.

1130
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:16,086
My goodness.

1131
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:19,812
Are you two at it again?

1132
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:24,502
Oh re garde, never was I
so glad to behold anyone.

1133
00:57:24,502 --> 00:57:26,138
There's a catch in this somewhere,

1134
00:57:26,138 --> 00:57:27,114
they're too glad to see us.

1135
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,218
Annette isn't, she loves me.

1136
00:57:28,218 --> 00:57:30,687
Misuer, you have the
chance to do two ladies

1137
00:57:30,687 --> 00:57:31,854
a great favor.

1138
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:34,922
Uh oh, here it comes.

1139
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:38,026
And at the same time, do
something grand for your country.

1140
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:40,723
Mmm hmm, I don't like the
way they're leading up to this.

1141
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,435
Uh what will you girls have?

1142
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:43,696
Oh it is nothing.

1143
00:57:43,696 --> 00:57:44,799
Oh tis nothing.

1144
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,763
Well we can handle it.

1145
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:49,213
All you have to do is
deliver this to General Hale.

1146
00:57:49,213 --> 00:57:51,742
Now why didn't you say
so in the first place?

1147
00:57:51,742 --> 00:57:54,192
You see we're great fans of General Hale.

1148
00:57:54,192 --> 00:57:55,122
And his partner.

1149
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:56,284
His partner?

1150
00:57:56,284 --> 00:57:57,939
Yeah, you don't mean to tell me

1151
00:57:57,939 --> 00:58:00,025
that you've never heard
of Hale and Hockey?

1152
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:01,534
(laughing)

1153
00:58:01,534 --> 00:58:02,367
Oh yes yes.

1154
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,032
We'd love to see dear old Hale again.

1155
00:58:05,032 --> 00:58:06,468
Where abouts in Paris is he?

1156
00:58:06,468 --> 00:58:08,355
Ah General Hale is at the front.

1157
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:10,269
Oh he's at the front?

1158
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:12,184
Oh he's at the front.

1159
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:14,350
Hmm, it must be some other Hale.

1160
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,473
Yes well, so long girls.

1161
00:58:16,473 --> 00:58:17,695
We'll see ya around.

1162
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,247
Oh you're not gonna back out?

1163
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:22,469
Back out, no, I'm gonna
walk right out face forward.

1164
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:23,651
You see,

1165
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:26,299
our schedule is so filled up for the day.

1166
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:29,479
Oh but this will make
you a great big hero.

1167
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:34,068
Yeah, it'll probably make
me the unknown soldier.

1168
00:58:34,068 --> 00:58:36,375
Wait a minute Gilbert.

1169
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:37,375
Let's do it.

1170
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:41,272
I wanna be a hero, for Annette.

1171
00:58:41,272 --> 00:58:44,417
You see, he wants to do
something great for his country.

1172
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:47,029
He aspire, do you not?

1173
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:47,928
Ma'am?

1174
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:49,352
You aspire.

1175
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:51,311
Yeah little under hand.

1176
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,144
Ah.

1177
00:58:52,144 --> 00:58:54,133
Aw Tommy, you'll do it won't ya?

1178
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:55,273
Sure I will.

1179
00:58:55,273 --> 00:58:57,556
But I want Gilbert to go with me.

1180
00:58:57,556 --> 00:58:59,831
You and Tommy go in there,

1181
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:03,232
so I can persuade
Gilbert to be a hero too.

1182
00:59:03,232 --> 00:59:06,402
Ha ha, you might but,
it will be difficult

1183
00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:07,902
in broad daylight.

1184
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:22,876
You're not gonna disappoint me are ya?

1185
00:59:22,876 --> 00:59:25,211
Not for anything in
the world sweetheart.

1186
00:59:25,211 --> 00:59:27,535
If you take these
papers to General Hale,

1187
00:59:27,535 --> 00:59:30,388
maybe dad 'll forgive ya for being AWOl.

1188
00:59:30,388 --> 00:59:32,755
Gee I'm ashamed a myself.

1189
00:59:32,755 --> 00:59:34,964
Ya know I'm an awful sap.

1190
00:59:34,964 --> 00:59:38,067
But since I met you,
everything has changed.

1191
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:40,924
I wanna be what you want me to be.

1192
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:41,757
My hero.

1193
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:45,147
First you must tell
me all about yourself.

1194
00:59:45,147 --> 00:59:48,685
Well I'm afraid that would
take a long time, a long time.

1195
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,853
For instance, I spent all last summer

1196
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,655
shooting tigers in Africa.

1197
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,181
But misuer, there are
no tigers in Africa.

1198
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:56,570
I know it, I killed 'em all.

1199
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,159
(laughing)

1200
00:59:58,159 --> 00:59:59,427
Come sit over here.

1201
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:01,713
Yes, yes, let's, let's.

1202
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:02,546
Hi ho.

1203
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,167
Ya know they laughed
at me when I sat down.

1204
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,365
But when I begin to play.

1205
01:00:08,365 --> 01:00:09,920
(laughing)

1206
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,981
my goodness, what well
developed arms you have.

1207
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:15,250
Yes, you see I play a lot of tennis.

1208
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,395
Yes.

1209
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:19,018
You dance a lot too don't ya?

1210
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:20,811
Oh you bad boy.

1211
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:23,054
Olga, I bet you dance
exactly like a heifer.

1212
01:00:23,054 --> 01:00:23,905
What?

1213
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:25,252
Zephyr, zephyr.

1214
01:00:25,252 --> 01:00:27,641
(laughing)

1215
01:00:27,641 --> 01:00:29,534
Well honey, how bout it?

1216
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:30,929
How bout what?

1217
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:31,762
Our,

1218
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:32,726
(clears throat)

1219
01:00:32,726 --> 01:00:34,830
how bout you an me get married.

1220
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:35,663
If I marry you, do you think

1221
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:38,246
you will be able to support me?

1222
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:40,869
I was afraid you were gonna ask me that.

1223
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:42,584
Ah Gilbert, you are so fascinating.

1224
01:00:42,584 --> 01:00:44,784
Yes I suppose so.

1225
01:00:44,784 --> 01:00:47,110
You could be such a great man.

1226
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,318
Take Napoleon, he was a great man.

1227
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:50,906
Yeah but he's a bust now.

1228
01:00:50,906 --> 01:00:52,617
(laughing)

1229
01:00:52,617 --> 01:00:55,268
Gilbert, you come from
fighting stock, do you not?

1230
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:58,002
Fighting stock, I'll say I do.

1231
01:00:58,002 --> 01:01:00,325
Father and mother were always at it,

1232
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:02,451
dog darn you couldn't stop 'em right.

1233
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:03,877
(laughing)

1234
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:06,365
Well I tell you, I come
from nice family too.

1235
01:01:06,365 --> 01:01:07,710
My father was born in Moscow,

1236
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:09,508
my mother was born in Vladivostok,

1237
01:01:09,508 --> 01:01:11,223
and I was born in St. Petersburg.

1238
01:01:11,223 --> 01:01:12,693
Is that so.

1239
01:01:12,693 --> 01:01:14,323
Funny how ya all got together.

1240
01:01:14,323 --> 01:01:15,872
(laughing)

1241
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:16,705
Ah.

1242
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:20,525
Little oh father Roy.

1243
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:22,108
No it's his father.

1244
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:26,733
Look, look he's brought
along a hunk a ginger ale.

1245
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:28,859
Ginger ale, that's champagne,

1246
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:30,370
an it has one big kick.

1247
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:31,998
Yeah, is that so?

1248
01:01:31,998 --> 01:01:33,470
Stick around son, stick around.

1249
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,281
You know Gilbert,
when I bring champagne,

1250
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:38,406
I never know what I am doing.

1251
01:01:38,406 --> 01:01:40,936
Now wait a minute, let's
get this thing straight.

1252
01:01:40,936 --> 01:01:42,941
Do you mean to tell me
when you drink this stuff

1253
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:45,149
you never know what you're doing?

1254
01:01:45,149 --> 01:01:46,131
Not a thing.

1255
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:48,332
I won't need you anymore son,

1256
01:01:48,332 --> 01:01:49,392
I won't need you anymore.

1257
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:51,551
(laughing)

1258
01:01:51,551 --> 01:01:53,959
By the way Olga, where
did you say you were from?

1259
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:55,017
St. Petersburg.

1260
01:01:55,017 --> 01:01:56,729
St. Petersburg.

1261
01:01:56,729 --> 01:01:58,439
Now that is a coincidence.

1262
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:00,070
You know a thing like
that wouldn't happen again

1263
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,547
in a million years, I tell you
it's a small world after all.

1264
01:02:03,547 --> 01:02:05,632
Are you from St. Petersburg too?

1265
01:02:05,632 --> 01:02:07,145
No I'm from Seattle.

1266
01:02:07,145 --> 01:02:09,837
(laughing)

1267
01:02:09,837 --> 01:02:12,242
Oh Gilbert, I beginning to feel good.

1268
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:13,627
Yeah but you,

1269
01:02:13,627 --> 01:02:14,956
you still know what you're doin' don't ya?

1270
01:02:14,956 --> 01:02:16,064
Oh yes, mm hmm.

1271
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:18,578
Well have another drink huh?

1272
01:02:18,578 --> 01:02:20,010
(laughing)

1273
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,853
Hey how bout little kiss.

1274
01:02:21,853 --> 01:02:23,198
No no no,

1275
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,357
the Colonel of your
regiment is going to stop

1276
01:02:25,357 --> 01:02:26,900
all swooning and kissing.

1277
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,427
Well he ought to, he's gettin'

1278
01:02:28,427 --> 01:02:29,793
too old for that sorta stuff.

1279
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:30,851
(laughing)

1280
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:32,752
I talk to him all the time huh.

1281
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:36,244
Oh Gilbert, I could love a man like you.

1282
01:02:36,244 --> 01:02:38,202
If you would only do something.

1283
01:02:38,202 --> 01:02:40,244
Well how can I do anything?

1284
01:02:40,244 --> 01:02:42,209
You kinda got me hog tied.

1285
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:43,131
(laughing)

1286
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:44,519
Something big.

1287
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:46,061
I mean something heroic,

1288
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:47,074
something like

1289
01:02:47,074 --> 01:02:48,754
(speaking in foreign language)

1290
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,345
Oh that, anytime you say baby.

1291
01:02:50,345 --> 01:02:51,678
Anytime you say.

1292
01:02:52,695 --> 01:02:55,058
You will go to General Hale for me?

1293
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:57,304
I'll go to Hale for you
anytime baby, anytime.

1294
01:02:57,304 --> 01:03:00,324
Oh I knew you would deliver the papers.

1295
01:03:00,324 --> 01:03:01,753
What's that?

1296
01:03:01,753 --> 01:03:04,205
You're going to take
the papers to the front.

1297
01:03:04,205 --> 01:03:06,404
Honey you lied to me
about that champagne,

1298
01:03:06,404 --> 01:03:08,073
you know what you were doin'.

1299
01:03:08,073 --> 01:03:09,990
Now I know that you love me.

1300
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,437
Oh love ya, honey I'm mad about ya.

1301
01:03:12,437 --> 01:03:13,786
I'm mad about ya.

1302
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:15,942
To me, you're a beautiful spite,

1303
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:18,103
sprite, sprite, sprite.

1304
01:03:18,103 --> 01:03:20,143
Oh why do I ever vent like this?

1305
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:22,429
Why do I ever vent.

1306
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:25,655
(playful music)

1307
01:03:25,655 --> 01:03:28,187
You know that I haven't
effervesced like this in years?

1308
01:03:28,187 --> 01:03:32,354
What have you done to me boy,
what have you done to me?

1309
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:36,179
♫ I've been a part foiled all of my life

1310
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,759
♫ But you have punctured my shell

1311
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:41,126
♫ I have never had a wife

1312
01:03:41,126 --> 01:03:45,448
♫ For married life is swell

1313
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:47,981
♫ You love ceasing your
life like sweet perfume

1314
01:03:47,981 --> 01:03:52,148
♫ In the springtime bursting into bloom ♫

1315
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:57,122
(singing in foreign language)

1316
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,914
Hey now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1317
01:04:02,914 --> 01:04:06,747
(singing in foreign language)

1318
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:09,767
Do I affect you that way honey?

1319
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:13,729
(singing in foreign language)

1320
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:14,562
Mama.

1321
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:17,398
Oh now wait a minute.

1322
01:04:17,398 --> 01:04:21,398
(singing in a foreign language)

1323
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:28,990
Mama.

1324
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,007
(singing in a foreign language)

1325
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:32,905
Now look what you're doin' to me.

1326
01:04:32,905 --> 01:04:34,562
(singing in a foreign language)

1327
01:04:34,562 --> 01:04:37,145
Oh wait a minute now, wait a minute.

1328
01:04:37,145 --> 01:04:41,145
(singing in a foreign language)

1329
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,529
Oh war is war, war is war.

1330
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:50,529
(singing in a foreign language)

1331
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:03,114
(playful music)

1332
01:05:44,876 --> 01:05:47,907
(engine running)

1333
01:05:47,907 --> 01:05:49,391
Wait a minute Tommy, I'm goin' with ya.

1334
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,185
Have ya got the papers?

1335
01:05:51,185 --> 01:05:52,653
I got 'em right here Gilbert.

1336
01:05:52,653 --> 01:05:54,765
Then come, let's proceed to the front.

1337
01:05:54,765 --> 01:05:58,027
Ah you are gallant, you are
brave, you are everything.

1338
01:05:58,027 --> 01:06:00,394
You just about summed it all up, honey,

1339
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:01,818
you summed it all up.

1340
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:03,941
Oh Tommy, you must be careful.

1341
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:06,811
Don't worry about me baby, goodbye.

1342
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:10,147
And believe me honey,
nothin's gonna stop us

1343
01:06:10,147 --> 01:06:12,392
from takin' those papers to General Hale.

1344
01:06:12,392 --> 01:06:14,944
Farewell, farewell, you have no idea

1345
01:06:14,944 --> 01:06:17,277
how I'm gonna miss ya honey.

1346
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,643
(phone ringing)

1347
01:06:24,643 --> 01:06:25,910
Hello.

1348
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:26,743
Sir.

1349
01:06:27,753 --> 01:06:29,789
Oh yes sir, yes sir.

1350
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:31,460
General Hale for you sir.

1351
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,687
Tenth time today.

1352
01:06:32,687 --> 01:06:34,079
Yes General, yes General.

1353
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,833
Yes General, darn it I'm a yes man.

1354
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:40,000
Positively General, those papers
are on the way to you now.

1355
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:44,603
There's something you ought to know.

1356
01:06:44,603 --> 01:06:46,073
May we see you privately?

1357
01:06:46,073 --> 01:06:46,906
No.

1358
01:06:46,906 --> 01:06:49,292
This office is for army business,
not for family disputes.

1359
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:51,413
Well, what have you got
to say, go ahead, debrief.

1360
01:06:51,413 --> 01:06:52,827
Will debrief.

1361
01:06:52,827 --> 01:06:54,772
Annette stole the papers you gave Jim

1362
01:06:54,772 --> 01:06:56,546
to take to General Hale.

1363
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:57,379
What?

1364
01:07:02,614 --> 01:07:04,125
What did you do with them?

1365
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:06,572
Don't worry dad, they'll
get to General Hale.

1366
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:09,390
I gave 'em to two a the most
wonderful boys in the world.

1367
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,345
Gilbert Simkins and Tommy Turner.

1368
01:07:11,345 --> 01:07:13,099
What you gave them to scallywags

1369
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:16,340
I've been chasing for ten days?

1370
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,808
Why, will you tell me why?

1371
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:19,265
Cause I'm in love with Tommy Turner.

1372
01:07:19,265 --> 01:07:21,139
Dear gods and great Scott.

1373
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:23,176
And if he gets those
papers to General Hale

1374
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:25,175
you'll forgive him, an
then he can marry me.

1375
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:28,925
Forgive him, I'll have
him shot at sunrise.

1376
01:07:31,027 --> 01:07:32,610
At first the boys didn't wanna do it

1377
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:35,414
but your girlfriend Olga
helped me to coax them.

1378
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:37,697
Well very obliging.

1379
01:07:37,697 --> 01:07:39,698
What a family, what a family.

1380
01:07:39,698 --> 01:07:41,823
Well honest pop, I didn't mean any harm.

1381
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:43,497
Captain Jones.

1382
01:07:43,497 --> 01:07:45,664
(shouting from a distance)

1383
01:07:45,664 --> 01:07:47,175
Captain Jones.

1384
01:07:47,175 --> 01:07:48,234
Yes sir.

1385
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:50,236
Those two men Gilbert
Simkins and Tommy Turner

1386
01:07:50,236 --> 01:07:51,499
have the General's papers.

1387
01:07:51,499 --> 01:07:53,212
Cover every road leading to the front.

1388
01:07:53,212 --> 01:07:54,436
You must get those men.

1389
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:55,538
Send ten details, twenty details.

1390
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,716
Five details, but get those men.

1391
01:07:58,716 --> 01:07:59,549
Yes sir.

1392
01:08:01,951 --> 01:08:04,368
(explosions)

1393
01:08:11,202 --> 01:08:13,892
Tommy are you still
hangin' on to them papers?

1394
01:08:13,892 --> 01:08:16,015
I'm guardin' those papers with my life.

1395
01:08:16,015 --> 01:08:19,238
Then on to Hale brother, on to Hale.

1396
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:20,630
Here we go Gilbert.

1397
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,463
(engines running)

1398
01:08:30,785 --> 01:08:33,202
(explosions)

1399
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,059
Horned rimmed glasses and curly hair.

1400
01:08:54,059 --> 01:08:56,545
They've got important
instructions from headquarters.

1401
01:08:56,545 --> 01:08:59,795
General Hale says we've got to get 'em.

1402
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:04,288
(explosions)

1403
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:09,855
Where can we find General Hale sir?

1404
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:11,359
General Hale is farther front.

1405
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,223
How do we get to the front line sir?

1406
01:09:13,223 --> 01:09:14,952
The only way is through
that communicator transfer.

1407
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:16,373
What do you want to
see General Hale about?

1408
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:19,045
We have important papers for him sir.

1409
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:20,843
You're Simkins and Turner?

1410
01:09:20,843 --> 01:09:22,639
Oh Captain, how'd ya guess?

1411
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:25,056
(explosions)

1412
01:09:28,503 --> 01:09:31,544
The communicating trench
has just been blown sir.

1413
01:09:31,544 --> 01:09:33,339
They can't get through now Captain.

1414
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:37,339
Somebody 'll have to crawl
through that barrage.

1415
01:09:39,866 --> 01:09:42,272
I can't order a man to
go through that inferno.

1416
01:09:42,272 --> 01:09:43,855
Gimme those papers.

1417
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:49,007
I'll call for volunteers.

1418
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,303
Men,

1419
01:09:52,145 --> 01:09:53,053
I have some very important papers

1420
01:09:53,053 --> 01:09:55,653
that must reach General Hale at once.

1421
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:58,098
Communication to the front
line trenches is cut off.

1422
01:09:58,098 --> 01:10:00,420
I want a volunteer for this dangerous job.

1423
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:03,191
Say no more Captain, say no more.

1424
01:10:03,191 --> 01:10:05,608
(explosions)

1425
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:09,948
Simkins,

1426
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:11,985
you're made of the right stuff.

1427
01:10:11,985 --> 01:10:14,473
It's going to take a lot of
guts to get through there.

1428
01:10:14,473 --> 01:10:16,392
I understand exactly Captain,

1429
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:19,496
an I've got just the man for ya.

1430
01:10:19,496 --> 01:10:21,913
(explosions)

1431
01:10:26,604 --> 01:10:30,601
Private Turner sir, the
nerviest man in the whole army.

1432
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:34,673
Ah, Private Turner, here are the papers.

1433
01:10:34,673 --> 01:10:35,506
Good luck.

1434
01:10:36,641 --> 01:10:38,555
The best way over is
through that cut there.

1435
01:10:38,555 --> 01:10:39,388
Yes sir.

1436
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:43,334
(explosions)

1437
01:10:45,607 --> 01:10:47,584
Hey wait a minute Tommy.

1438
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:48,816
Gee kid I'm sorry.

1439
01:10:48,816 --> 01:10:51,025
I didn't mean to get ya into this.

1440
01:10:51,025 --> 01:10:52,874
Aw gee Gilbert, that's alright.

1441
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,254
Yeah but,

1442
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:57,251
you know if somethin's
liable to go wrong out there.

1443
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:58,514
Aw.

1444
01:10:58,514 --> 01:11:00,638
You know, ya might not come back.

1445
01:11:00,638 --> 01:11:01,492
Oh gee.

1446
01:11:01,492 --> 01:11:02,430
Now wait a minute.

1447
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,263
I'll get it.

1448
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:04,096
No,

1449
01:11:04,096 --> 01:11:05,329
I'll come back all right.

1450
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:07,167
It will be okay.

1451
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:09,203
But if I don't,

1452
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,727
you'll tell Annette, won't ya?

1453
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,440
Yeah I'll tell her.

1454
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,857
(explosions)

1455
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:40,953
Tommy.

1456
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:46,507
Hey where you goin'?

1457
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:48,588
Out there, think they got him.

1458
01:11:48,588 --> 01:11:50,670
But man, you can't go out there now.

1459
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,426
They'll blow you down
before you got ten feet.

1460
01:11:52,426 --> 01:11:54,385
That's alright buddy.

1461
01:11:54,385 --> 01:11:56,952
He needs me an I'm goin' for him.

1462
01:11:56,952 --> 01:11:59,369
(explosions)

1463
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:14,907
Where are ya kid, where are ya Tommy?

1464
01:12:14,907 --> 01:12:17,070
Here I am Gilbert.

1465
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,514
Gee Tommy, how is it
kid, did they get ya?

1466
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:21,764
I don't know.

1467
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:24,294
It's my back.

1468
01:12:25,455 --> 01:12:27,872
I don't seem to feel a thing.

1469
01:12:28,838 --> 01:12:31,255
(explosions)

1470
01:12:33,008 --> 01:12:33,925

01:12:41,058 --> 01:12:42,647
Do ya feel better now kid?

1474
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:44,980
Here, do ya feel that Tommy?

1475
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:48,190
I don't feel a thing.

1476
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,983
Wait a minute Tommy.

1477
01:12:49,983 --> 01:12:52,400
(explosions)

1478
01:13:06,022 --> 01:13:06,855
Hey.

1479
01:13:08,932 --> 01:13:11,349
(explosions)

1480
01:13:18,842 --> 01:13:22,342
(talking over each other)

1481
01:13:30,512 --> 01:13:32,360
The signing of the officers
to stave my reputation

1482
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,998
and stand in as an officer.

1483
01:13:33,998 --> 01:13:35,595
Is not only save the world for democracy,

1484
01:13:35,595 --> 01:13:38,345
but is to save me from my family.

1485
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,817
And don't forget,

1486
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,700
if I ever lay my hands
on those two dough boys.

1487
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,033
I'll deliver them to you piece by piece.

1488
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:53,987
Make way.

1489
01:13:57,569 --> 01:13:59,236
You who, surprise.

1490
01:14:01,988 --> 01:14:03,183
Any phone calls?

1491
01:14:03,183 --> 01:14:04,324
How dare you sir.

1492
01:14:04,324 --> 01:14:05,771
What do you mean by this?

1493
01:14:05,771 --> 01:14:07,071
What did you do with that
message for General Hale?

1494
01:14:07,071 --> 01:14:07,904
Why,

1495
01:14:07,904 --> 01:14:08,985
(clears throat)

1496
01:14:08,985 --> 01:14:10,175
we decided not to deliver it.

1497
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:11,808
Oh you did ey?

1498
01:14:11,808 --> 01:14:13,148
What did you do with it?

1499
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:14,617
We opened it up an read it.

1500
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:15,639
What?

1501
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:17,435
It's an old Indian custom Colonel,

1502
01:14:17,435 --> 01:14:19,355
an old Indian custom.

1503
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:22,620
In case we lost it, we could
deliver it by word of mouth.

1504
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,155
Ha, ya know I know every word by heart.

1505
01:14:25,155 --> 01:14:27,238
You'll be shot at sunrise.

1506
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:28,987
Ha ha, when you know what we know,

1507
01:14:28,987 --> 01:14:30,574
you'll be half shot at sunrise.

1508
01:14:30,574 --> 01:14:31,932
How dare ya, what are you doin?

1509
01:14:31,932 --> 01:14:33,896
(stammering)

1510
01:14:33,896 --> 01:14:35,811
Breathe now, whew.

1511
01:14:35,811 --> 01:14:38,748
You'll get a parallel stroke.

1512
01:14:38,748 --> 01:14:40,502
Colonel, I want to ask you,

1513
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:43,111
did you really want
this message delivered?

1514
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:44,444
To General Hale?

1515
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,282
(clears throat)

1516
01:15:01,282 --> 01:15:02,835
Come with me in my office.

1517
01:15:02,835 --> 01:15:05,752
I want to speak with you privately.

1518
01:15:14,401 --> 01:15:15,652
You

1519
01:15:15,652 --> 01:15:18,099
you, say you memorized this paper?

1520
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:20,013
Every darn word.

1521
01:15:20,013 --> 01:15:21,364
What did it say?

1522
01:15:21,364 --> 01:15:23,775
My dear snuggle puff.

1523
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,797
That's enough.

1524
01:15:24,797 --> 01:15:26,347
That's enough.

1525
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:30,097
Well if it isn't
enough, we know some more.

1526
01:15:32,589 --> 01:15:34,839
Do you know what I
could do to you for this?

1527
01:15:34,839 --> 01:15:36,797
(laughing)

1528
01:15:36,797 --> 01:15:38,387
What are you laughing at?

1529
01:15:38,387 --> 01:15:42,554
I was just thinking, what
we could do to you for this.

1530
01:15:44,228 --> 01:15:46,902
Colonel, what I wanna know is,

1531
01:15:46,902 --> 01:15:49,715
why did you treat little Olga so mean?

1532
01:15:49,715 --> 01:15:52,203
You know I was never so-

1533
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:53,453
motormen glove.

1534
01:15:54,457 --> 01:15:55,491
General Hale's plans.

1535
01:15:55,491 --> 01:15:56,608
Yeah.

1536
01:15:56,608 --> 01:15:57,524
Where did you get them?

1537
01:15:57,524 --> 01:15:59,098
I found 'em right here on my desk.

1538
01:15:59,098 --> 01:16:00,361
What does this mean?

1539
01:16:00,361 --> 01:16:02,932
It means that you sent
Olga's note to the General

1540
01:16:02,932 --> 01:16:04,399
instead a the plans.

1541
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:07,180
Oh that Olga, I'll have her neck.

1542
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,265
No Colonel, I'll have that.

1543
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:11,431
(laughing)

1544
01:16:11,431 --> 01:16:13,717
There ya go again, that's
the funniest thing ever.

1545
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:15,230
(laughing)

1546
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:17,320
You, something's got
to be done about this.

1547
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,786
Yes yes.

1548
01:16:18,786 --> 01:16:21,599
It seems as though, Armistice
has been declared for

1549
01:16:21,599 --> 01:16:22,945
everybody but you.

1550
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:24,701
(laughing)

1551
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:26,784
What, what, what, what?

1552
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:31,087
(background chatter)

1553
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:40,235
Quite a war isn't it, quite a war.

1554
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:44,499
You sent for Lieutenant Reed sir?

1555
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:47,561
Oh uh, certainly we
sent for Lieutenant Reed,

1556
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,743

1557
01:16:48,743 --> 01:16:51,660
Well, well, yes uh yes of course.

1558
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,280
The Colonel wants you two
kids to get married right away.

1559
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,587
Don't we Colonel.

1560
01:17:00,587 --> 01:17:02,298
(stammering)

1561
01:17:02,298 --> 01:17:03,848
Quite so, quite so, quite so.

1562
01:17:03,848 --> 01:17:07,323
Good heavens, the old man's gone crazy.

1563
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:09,450
My darling snuggle puff.

1564
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,405
Where were you last night?

1565
01:17:11,405 --> 01:17:14,056
I waited for you for hours.

1566
01:17:14,056 --> 01:17:17,157
Have you forgotten your Olga?

1567
01:17:17,157 --> 01:17:18,873
Colonel, there's nothing to it,

1568
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:20,624
we men have got to stick together.

1569
01:17:20,624 --> 01:17:22,828
Tommy, gee I'm glad you're back.

1570
01:17:22,828 --> 01:17:24,303
So am I.

1571
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:28,470
And the Colonel wants us
to be married right away.

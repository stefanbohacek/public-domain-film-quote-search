1
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,726
They ought to make the day the time changes
the first day of summer.

2
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,525
- What?
- Well, it's 8 o'clock and it's still light.

3
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,732
A lot of good the extra daylight does us.

4
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,611
Now, we've still got a three-hour drive back.
We're not gonna be home until after midnight.

5
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,319
Well, if it really bugged you, Johnny,
you wouldn't do it.

6
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,450
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

7
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,244
You know, I figure we're either gonna
have to move Mother out here,

8
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,246
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

9
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,500
- She can't make a trip like this.
- Oh, I don't know that she can't.

10
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,045
Is there any of that candy left?

11
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,377
No.

12
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,587
Look at this thing. "We still remember."

13
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,135
I don't. You know, I don't even remember
what the man looks like.

14
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,179
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

15
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,348
Yeah, five minutes
to put the wreath on the grave

16
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,875
and six hours to drive back and forth.

17
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,181
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles into the country

18
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:48,278
- and she stays at home.
- Well, we're here, John. All right?

19
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,734
<i>Testing. Are we back on?</i>

20
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,365
<i>Oh. Uh, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

21
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,491
Hey, do...

22
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,041
<i>we're coming back on the air after
an interruption due to technicalprobl...</i>

23
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,843
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

24
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,675
Which row is it in?

25
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,159
Boy, there's no one around.

26
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,954
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

27
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,163
Oh, look, I already lost an hour's sleep
on the time change.

28
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,335
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

29
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,088
There it is.

30
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,443
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

31
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,775
Each year we spend good money
on these things.

32
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,483
We come out here,
and the one from last year is gone.

33
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,408
Well, the flowers die, and the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

34
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:26,244
Yeah, a little spit and polish,
he can clean this up, sell it next year.

35
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,249
Wonder how many times
we've bought the same one.

36
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,770
Hey, come on, Barb.
Church was this morning, huh?

37
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,374
Hey, I mean, praying's for church, huh?

38
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,293
Come on.

39
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,945
I haven't seen you in church lately.

40
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:20,006
Well, there's not much sense
in my going to church.

41
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,721
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

42
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,428
It was from right over there.

43
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,433
I jumped out at you from behind a tree,

44
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,436
and Grandpa got all excited,
and he shook his fist at me and he said,

45
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,605
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."

46
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,813
Remember that? Right over there.

47
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,901
You used to really be scared here.

48
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,655
Johnny.

49
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,406
Hey, you're still afraid.

50
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,489
Stop it now. I mean it.

51
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,170
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

52
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,082
Stop it! You're ignorant!

53
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,088
They're coming for you, Barbra.

54
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,671
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

55
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,717
They're coming for you.

56
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,346
Look! There comes one of them now!

57
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,515
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes now.

58
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,632
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny!

59
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:20,027
No!

60
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,693
No! Johnny!

61
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,870
Help me! Help!

62
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,799
It's all right.

63
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,466
Don't worry about him. I can handle him.

64
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,550
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

65
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,224
Truck is out of gas.

66
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,272
This pump out here is locked. Is there a key?

67
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,820
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas. Is there a key?

68
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,157
I suppose you've tried this.

69
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,793
Do you live here?

70
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,391
Jesus.

71
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,696
We've gotta get out of here.

72
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,154
We have to get to where
there are some other people.

73
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,996
M-Maybe we better take some food.

74
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,374
I'll see if I can find some food.

75
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,794
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.

76
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,011
What's happening?

77
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,235
Two of them.

78
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,113
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

79
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,657
- I can take care of those two.
- I don't know. I don't know.

80
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,785
- I know you're afraid, but we have to...
- I don't know! I don't know!

81
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:15,889
What's happening?

82
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,058
They know we're in here now.

83
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,529
Don't look at it.

84
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,105
Get some more lights on in this house.

85
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,561
Why don't you see if you can find some wood,
some boards, something there by the fireplace,

86
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,644
something we can nail this place up.

87
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,150
Look, goddamn it...

88
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,200
Look. I know you're afraid.

89
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,369
I'm afraid too.

90
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,077
But we have to try to
board the house up together.

91
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,375
Now, I'm going to board up the windows
and the doors. Do you understand?

92
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,002
We'll be all right here.

93
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,710
We'll be all right here
till someone comes to rescue us.

94
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,715
But we have to work together.
You'll have to help me.

95
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,718
Now, go in and get some wood
so I can board the place up.

96
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,096
Do you understand? Okay?

97
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,345
Okay?

98
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,550
That'll hold 'em.
Those things aren't that strong.

99
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,100
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.

100
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,267
There. This room looks pretty secure.

101
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,231
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

102
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:30,447
Won't be long before those things'll be back,
pounding their way in here. They're afraid now.

103
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,911
They're afraid of fire. I found that out.

104
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,306
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's Diner?

105
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,062
Anyhow, that's where I found that truck
I have out there.

106
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,150
There's a radio in the truck.

107
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,403
I had jumped in to listen to it...

108
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,618
when a big gasoline truck
came screaming right across the road.

109
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:19,079
Well, there must have been
10, 15 of those things chasing after it,

110
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,047
grabbing and holding on.

111
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,337
I didn't see them at first.

112
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,346
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

113
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,136
And those things were catching up to it.

114
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,774
Truck went right across the road.

115
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,524
Slammed on my brakes
to keep from hitting it myself.

116
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,607
It went right through the guardrail.

117
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,408
I guess...

118
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,992
I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

119
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,123
into that gas station by Beekman's Diner.

120
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,539
It went right through the billboard,

121
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,462
ripped over a gas pump
and never stopped moving.

122
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,170
By now it was like a moving bonfire.

123
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,593
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

124
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,815
I can still hear the man screaming...

125
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,399
these things just backing away from it.

126
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,365
I looked back at the diner to see if there
was anyone there who could help me.

127
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,786
That was when I noticed that...

128
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,047
the entire place had been encircled.

129
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,634
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

130
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,758
By now, there were no more screams.

131
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,473
I realized that...

132
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,643
I was alone,

133
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,477
with 50 or 60 of those things

134
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,565
just standing there, staring at me.

135
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,989
I-I started to drive. I...

136
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,323
just plowed right through them.

137
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,708
They didn't move. They didn't run or...

138
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,708
Just stood there, staring at me.

139
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,710
I just wanted to crush them.

140
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,463
They...

141
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,180
scattered through the air, like bugs.

142
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,478
We were riding in the cemetery...

143
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,775
Johnny and me.

144
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,236
Johnny.

145
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,529
We...

146
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:59,660
We came to put a wreath on my father's grave,

147
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,580
Johnny and m...

148
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,745
And he said,

149
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,877
"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"

150
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,012
And we didn't have any.

151
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,550
And...

152
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,555
Oh, it's hot in here.

153
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,099
Hot.

154
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,610
Uh, and he said,

155
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,653
"Oh, it's late.

156
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,531
Why did we start so late?"

157
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,949
And I said,

158
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:46,377
"Johnny, if you'd gotten up earlier,
we wouldn't be late."

159
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,834
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.

160
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,963
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny."

161
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,181
And then this man
started walking up the road.

162
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,138
He came slowly,

163
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,557
and Johnny kept teasing me and saying,

164
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,106
"He's coming to get you, Barbra."

165
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,027
And I laughed at him and said,
"Johnny, stop it."

166
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,773
And then Johnny ran away.

167
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,233
And I...

168
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:21,697
I went up to this man,
and I was going to apologize.

169
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,493
Why don't you just keep calm?

170
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,411
And I looked up, and...

171
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,084
and I said, "Good eve..."

172
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,126
And he grabbed me.

173
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,169
He grabbed me!

174
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,588
And he ripped at me!

175
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,547
He held me and he ripped at my clothes!

176
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,177
I think you should just calm down.

177
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,930
Oh, I screamed, "Johnny!

178
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,637
Johnny, help me!

179
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,848
Oh, help me!"

180
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,852
And he wouldn't let me go.

181
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,435
He ripped...

182
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:59,069
And then Johnny came, and he ran,
and he... he fought this man.

183
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,904
And I got so afraid, I ran.

184
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,283
I ran.

185
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,494
I ran.

186
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,915
And Johnny didn't come.

187
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,712
We've got... We have to wait for Johnny.

188
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,057
Maybe we'd better go out and get him.

189
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,764
We have to go out and get Johnny.

190
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,346
He's out there.

191
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,102
Please! Don't you hear me?

192
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,355
We've got to go out and get him.

193
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,316
Please!

194
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,985
We have got to go get Johnny!

195
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,068
Please help me!

196
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,864
Please!

197
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,908
Don't you know what's going on out there?
This is no Sunday school picnic.

198
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,953
Don't you understand? My brother is alone!

199
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,286
- Your brother is dead.
- No!

200
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,463
My brother is <i>not</i> dead!

201
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,692
No!

202
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,761
<i>Because of the obvious threat
to untold numbers of citizens,</i>

203
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,598
<i>and because of the crisis
which is even now developing,</i>

204
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,059
<i>this radio station will remain
on the air, day and night.</i>

205
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,856
<i>This station and hundreds
of other radio and TV stations</i>

206
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,483
<i>throughout this part of the country</i>

207
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,528
<i>are pooling their resources
through an emergency network hookup</i>

208
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,986
<i>to keep you informed of all developments.</i>

209
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,908
<i>At this hour, we repeat,
these are the facts as we know them.</i>

210
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,452
<i>There is an epidemic of mass murder
being committed</i>

211
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,455
<i>by a virtual army of unidentified assassins.</i>

212
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:19,709
<i>The murders are taking place
in villages, cities, rural homes, and suburbs</i>

213
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,754
<i>with no apparent pattern
or reason for the slayings.</i>

214
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,464
<i>It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.</i>

215
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,094
<i>We have some descriptions of the assassins.</i>

216
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,888
<i>Eyewitnesses say
they are ordinary-looking people.</i>

217
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,471
<i>Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.</i>

218
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,931
<i>Others describe them as being...</i>

219
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,986
<i>So, at this point there is no
really authentic way for us to say</i>

220
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,159
<i>who or what to look for
and guard yourself against...</i>

221
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,492
<i>misshapen monsters.</i>

222
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,290
<i>Reaction of law enforcement officials
is one of complete bewilderment at this hour.</i>

223
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,959
<i>So far we have been unable to determine</i>

224
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,212
<i>that any kind of
organized investigation is yet under way.</i>

225
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,132
<i>Police, sheriffs' deputies
and emergency ambulances</i>

226
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,634
<i>are literally deluged with calls for help.</i>

227
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,053
<i>The scene can best be described as mayhem.</i>

228
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,806
<i>Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,</i>

229
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,851
<i>along with the governors of several
Eastern and Midwestern states,</i>

230
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,104
<i>have indicated the national guard
may be mobilized at any moment,</i>

231
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,061
<i>but that has not happened as yet.</i>

232
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:27,110
<i>The only advice our reporters
have been able to get from official sources</i>

233
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,445
<i>is for private citizens to stay
in their homes behind locked doors.</i>

234
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,656
<i>Do not venture outside for any reason</i>

235
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,036
<i>until the nature of this crisis
has been determined</i>

236
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,870
<i>and until we can advise
what course of action to take.</i>

237
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,249
<i>Keep listening to radio and TV</i>

238
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,253
<i>for any special instructions
as this crisis develops further.</i>

239
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,756
<i>Thousands of office and factory workers</i>

240
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,383
<i>are being urged
to stay at their places of employment,</i>

241
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,966
<i>not to make any attempt
to get to their homes.</i>

242
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,138
<i>However, in spite of this urging and warning,</i>

243
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,223
<i>streets and highways are packed with
frantic people trying to reach their families,</i>

244
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,895
<i>or apparently to flee just anywhere.</i>

245
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:06,401
<i>We repeat: The safest course of action
at this time is simply to stay where you...</i>

246
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,796
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just received word</i>

247
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,504
<i>that the president
has called a meeting of his cabinet</i>

248
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,551
<i>to deal with the sudden epidemic of murder</i>

249
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,053
<i>which has seized
the eastern third of this nation.</i>

250
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,472
<i>The meeting is scheduled
to convene within the hour.</i>

251
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,474
<i>Members of the presidential cabinet</i>

252
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:44,396
<i>will be joined by officials of the FBI
and the joint chiefs behind closed doors.</i>

253
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,979
<i>A White House spokesman,
in announcing this conference,</i>

254
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:50,777
<i>says there will be an official announcement
as soon as possible following that meeting.</i>

255
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,697
<i>This is the latest dispatch
just received in our newsroom.</i>

256
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:58,908
<i>Latest word also from national press services
in Washington, DC, now tells us</i>

257
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,705
<i>that the emergency presidential conference
which we've just mentioned</i>

258
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,707
<i>will include high-ranking scientists</i>

259
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,751
<i>from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.</i>

260
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,895
<i>That's the extent of this latest...</i>

261
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,305
<i>All radio and TV stations
across the eastern part of the country,</i>

262
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,391
<i>including the one to which you are listening,</i>

263
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,812
<i>have joined their facilities
in an emergency network</i>

264
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,020
<i>to bring you this news as it develops.</i>

265
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:34,404
<i>We urge you to stay tuned to radio and TV
and to stay indoors at all costs.</i>

266
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,363
<i>Late reports reaching this newsroom
tell of frightened people</i>

267
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,410
<i>seeking refuge in churches, schools,
and government buildings,</i>

268
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,288
<i>demanding shelter and protection
from the wholesale murder</i>

269
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,332
<i>which apparently is engulfing
much of the nation.</i>

270
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:49,836
<i>Law enforcement officials are at a loss
to explain or, even at this hour,</i>

271
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,214
<i>even to theorize about the reasons
for this wave of murder.</i>

272
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,924
<i>So far, all they're able to give the public
is something similar to the response</i>

273
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,135
<i>of Chief T.K. Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina,</i>

274
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,140
<i>who is quoted as saying, quote,</i>

275
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,018
<i>"Tell the people, for God's sake,
to get off the streets.</i>

276
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,352
<i>Tell 'em to go home
and lock their doors and windows up tight.</i>

277
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:12,025
<i>We don't know what kind of
murder-happy characters we have here."</i>

278
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,735
<i>End quote. That's Chief Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina.</i>

279
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,906
<i>So far the only descriptions,
the only clues anyone has of the killers</i>

280
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,161
<i>come from frightened witnesses.</i>

281
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,916
<i>These eyewitness accounts variously describe
the murderers as "ordinary looking people, "</i>

282
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:31,586
<i>"misshapen monsters,"
"people who look like they're in a trance, "</i>

283
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,546
<i>and "things that look like people
but act like animals."</i>

284
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,676
<i>Some eyewitnesses tell of seeing victims</i>

285
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,929
<i>who look as though they had been torn apart.</i>

286
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,307
<i>This whole ghastly story
began developing two days ago</i>

287
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,559
<i>with the report of the slaying
of a family of seven</i>

288
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,978
<i>in their rural home near Gulfport, Louisiana.</i>

289
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,482
<i>Since then, reports of some
senseless killings began snowballing</i>

290
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:56,486
<i>in a reign of terror which has hopscotched
in an erratic and disconnected pattern</i>

291
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,570
<i>throughout much of the eastern
and midwestern United States.</i>

292
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,702
<i>Efforts to keep track of the murder reports
by the placing of markers on a map</i>

293
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,787
<i>seem to indicate a general spreading
from the extreme southeastern United States</i>

294
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,371
<i>to the north and west.</i>

295
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,877
<i>Our newsmen have been on the telephone,
talking with officials in other cities,</i>

296
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,336
<i>and have determined
that none of this kind of mass murder</i>

297
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,883
<i>has yet been reported
west of the Mississippi River,</i>

298
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,344
<i>except in the extreme
southeastern portion of Texas.</i>

299
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,641
<i>Similar killings have been reported
around the Houston and Galveston areas,</i>

300
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,725
<i>- but nothing like the...</i>
- I found a gun and some bullets out there.

301
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,605
<i>- It was only late yesterday...</i>
- Oh, and these.

302
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:36,651
<i>That it soon became clear that we were
facing some kind of national emergency.</i>

303
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,028
<i>When first reports began filtering in,</i>

304
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,281
<i>newsmen and law enforcement agencies
were of the opinion...</i>

305
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,785
This place is boarded up pretty solid now.

306
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,787
We ought to be all right here for a while.

307
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,708
We have the gun and the bullets,
food and the radio.

308
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,711
<i>...began to suspect</i>
<i>an obscure kind of conspiracy.</i>

309
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,714
Sooner or later,
someone's bound to come and get us out.

310
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,466

312
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,681
<i>Lock the doors and windows securely.</i>

313
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,683
Hey, that's us. We're doing all right.

314
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,016
<i>Be cautious of any suspicious strangers,</i>

315
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,727
<i>and keep tuned to your radio and television
for survival instructions</i>

316
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,188
<i>and further details of this continuing story.</i>

317
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,294
Look, I don't know if you're hearing me...

318
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:20,651
but I'm going upstairs now.

319
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,986
<i>It's almost as though
some critical balance...</i>

320
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,366
If anything should try to break in here,
I can hear it from up there.

321
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,949
I'll be down to take care of it.

322
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,534
<i>We repeat: This radio station...</i>

323
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:34,083
Everything is all right for now. I'll be back
to reinforce the windows and doors later.

324
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,507
But you'll be all right for now. Okay?

325
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,720
Okay?

326

<i>Consistent reports from witnesses

330
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,937
<i>that people who acted as though

<i>civil defense authorities have told newsmen

338

Calm... Calm down! Calm down!

Hold it! Don't shoot. We're from town.

349
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,462
- A radio!
<i>- ...Butler County, Pennsylvania.</i>

<i>The Butler County sheriff has verified

<i>No further details available at this time.
However...</i>

353
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,016
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

354
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,643
That's the cellar. It's the safest place.

355
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,395
You mean you didn't hear the racket
we were making up here?

356
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,603
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

357
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,859
- Could've been those things, for all we knew.
- That girl was screaming.

358
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,028
Surely you must know
what a girl screaming sounds like.

359
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,360
Those things don't make any noise.

360
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,657
Anybody would know
somebody's in need of help.

361
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,365
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

362
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,370
We thought we could hear screams,

363
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,373
but for all we knew that could have meant
those things were in the house after her.

364
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,582
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more...

365
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,711
The racket sounded like
the place was being ripped apart.

366
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,755
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

367
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:29,590
Now, wait a minute. You just got finished
saying you couldn't hear from down there.

368
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,011
Now you say it sounded like
this place was being ripped apart.

369
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,219
It would be nice
if you'd get your story straight, man.

370
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,975
All right, now you tell <i>me.</i>

371
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,979
I'm not gonna take that kind of a chance
when we've got a safe place.

372
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,313
We luck into a safe place, and you're
telling us we've gotta risk our lives

373
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,818
just because somebody might need help, huh?

374
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,150
Yeah. Something like that.

375
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,860
- All right, why don't we settle this...
- Look, mister!

376
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,157
We came up, okay? We're here.

377
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,911
I suggest we all go back downstairs before
any of those things find out we're in here.

378
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,994
They can't get in here.

379
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,705
- You got the whole place boarded up?
- Yeah, most of it.

380
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,585
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

381
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,463
You're insane. The cellar's the safest place.

382
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,590
I'm telling you, they can't get in here.

383
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,719
And I'm telling you,
those things turned over our car.

384
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,512
We were damned lucky to get away at all.

385
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,933
Now you tell me those things
can't get through this lousy pile of wood?

386
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,310
His wife and kid's downstairs.

387
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,892
The kid's hurt.

388
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,730
Well, I still think we're better off up here.

389
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,983
We could strengthen everything up,
Mr. Cooper.

390
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,238
With all of us working,
we could fix this place up in no time.

391
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,240
We have everything we need up here.

392
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,948
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

393
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,745
Man, you're really crazy. You know that?

394
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,122
You got a million windows up here.
All these windows.

395
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,000
You're gonna make them strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

396
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,044
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

397
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,627
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

398
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,133
Did you hear me when I told you
they turned over our car?

399
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,303
- Oh, hell, any good five men can do that.
- That's my point.

400
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,597
Only there's not going to be five,
or even 10.

401
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,099
There's gonna be 20, 30,
maybe a hundred of those things.

402
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,894
And as soon as they know we're here,
this place is gonna be crawling with them.

403
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:06,397
Well, if there are that many,
they'll probably get us wherever we are.

404
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,481
Look, the cellar.

405
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:14,070
The cellar, there's only one door, right?
Just one door. That's all we have to protect.

406
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:17,366
Tom and I fixed it
so it locks and boards from the inside.

407
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:21,245
But up here, all these windows, why, we'd never
know where they were gonna hit us next.

408
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,289
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

409
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,747
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

410
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,460
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

411
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,919
Ah!

412
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,924
We can get out of here if we have to.

413
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,883
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

414
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,764
But down there, with no windows, if a rescue
party did come, we wouldn't even know it.

415
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,058
But the cellar is the strongest place.

416
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,765
The cellar is a death trap.

417
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,270
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.

418
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,189
I think he's right.

419
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,066
You know how many's out there?

420
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,068
I don't know. I figure maybe six or seven.

421
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,613
Look. You two can do whatever you like.

422
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,740
I'm going back down to the cellar

423
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,993
and you better decide,
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

424
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,746
and I'm not gonna unlock it again,
no matter what happens.

425
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,079
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
- No, I'm not gonna wait!

426
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:08,290
I've made my decision. Now you make yours.

427
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,962
Now, wait a minute! Let's think about this.

428
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,840
We can make it to the cellar if we have to.

429
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,049
And if we do decide to stay down there,
we'll need some things from up here.

430
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,096
So let's at least consider this a while.

431
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,973
<i>...at all costs.</i>

432
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,975
<i>Late reports reaching this newsroom...</i>

433
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,395
If you box yourself in the cellar and
those things get in the house, you've had it.

434
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,523
At least up here you have a fighting chance.

435
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,529
Yeah, it looks like
about eight or 10 out there now.

436
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,612
That's more than there were.

437
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,783
There are a lot out back too.

438
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,866
<i>So far, the best advice they're...</i>

439
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,118
- Harry?
- It's all right.

440
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,451
- Harry, what's happening?
- It's... It's all right!

441
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,179
Damn thing.

442
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,843
We gotta fix these boards.

443
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,552
You're crazy!

444
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,975
Those things are gonna be
at every window and door in this place!

445
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:30,768
We've got to get down into the cellar.

446
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,646
Go down in your damn cellar! Get out of here!

447
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,023
- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

448
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,153
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

449
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,823
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

450
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,575
and the radio and the food
is part of what I'm fighting for.

451
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,500
- If you're going down in the cellar, get.
- The man's insane.

452
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,664
He's insane.

453
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,958
We've got to have food down there.
We've got a right.

454
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,252
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

455
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,796
- You going down there with him?
- W-Well, I...

456
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,800
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

457
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,136
Listen, I got a kid down there.

458
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,138
She can't possib...
I couldn't bring her up here.

459
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,933
She can't possibly take all the racket from
those things smashing through the windows.

460
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,810
Well, you're her father.

461
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,518
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

462
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,691
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

463
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,025
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

464
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,611
Now, get the hell down in the cellar.

465
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,538
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

466
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,828
You bastards!

467
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,955
You know, I won't open this door again.
I mean it.

468
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,878
- Mr. Cooper, with your help, we can...
- With my help!

469
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:42,337
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up. Just let him go.

470
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,219
Wait a minute.

471
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,556
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

472
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,446
- You're gonna let them get her too, huh?
- It's all right, honey. Go ahead.

473
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,747
If we stick together, man,
we can fix it up real good.

474
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:18,081
But there... there's lots of places
we can run to up here.

475
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,791
Mr. Cooper?

476
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:24,095
We'd all be a lot better off
if all three of us were working together.

477
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,967
Hey.

478
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,549
Hey, kid.

479
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,854
He's wrong, you know.

480
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,273
I'm not boxing myself in down there.

481
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,948
<i>To repeat, this radio station
will remain on the air day and night.</i>

482
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:51,907
Well, we're safe now. It's boarded up tight.

483
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,828
What about Tom and Judy?

484
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,002
They wanna stay up there, let 'em.

485
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:03,342
There are... two other people upstairs.

486
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,882
- A man and a girl.
- We heard the screaming.

487
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,634
Yeah, but I didn't know who they were,

488
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,762
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

489
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,845
Of course not, Harry.

490
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,613
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

491
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,321
She feels warm. Maybe it's shock.

492
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,325
Where'd you get the bandage?

493
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,707
Some laundry in a basket. I tore a sheet.

494
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,258
Let them stay upstairs.

495
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,549
Let them.

496
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,511
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

497
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,850
We'll see who's right.

498
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,150
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

499
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,939
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?

500
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,523
- To be right. Everybody else to be wrong.
- What do you mean by that?

501
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,154
Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?

502
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,825
Whatever it is, it isn't just happening here.

503
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,162
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.

504
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,248
- The radio said to stay inside...
- Radio?

505
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,083
Radio, upstairs. I heard a news bulletin.

506
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,881
There's a radio upstairs,
and you boarded us in down here?

507
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,799
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?

508
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,219
Nothing! Nothing!
They don't know anything yet.

509
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,096
The... There's mass murder everywhere,

510
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,891
and people are supposed to look
for a safe place to hide.

511
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,435
Take the boards off that door.

512
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,562
We are staying down here, Helen.

513
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,815
Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.

514
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,194
If the authorities know what's happening,
well, they'll send people for us,

515
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,071
or they'll tell us what to do.

516
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:56,076
How are we going to know what's going on
if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?

517
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,171
We may not enjoy living together...

518
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,841
but dying together
isn't going to solve anything.

519
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,764
Those people aren't our enemies.

520
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,093
Mr. Cooper!

521
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,556
Mr. Cooper?
Ben found a television set upstairs.

522
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,730
Let's go up. Tom?

523
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,148
Yes.

524
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,607
If Judy would come downstairs
for a few minutes,

525
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,405
Harry and I could come upstairs.

526
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,079
Okay. Yeah. Right away.

527
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,162
- Will you do it?
- Do I have to?

528
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:46,088
Look, honey, nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

529
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,253
Do this, for me.

530
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,835
Okay.

531
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,220
Okay, open up.

532
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,156
I'll take good care of her, Helen.

533
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,873
She's all I have.

534
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,836
Why don't you go upstairs now?

535
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,277
Her brother was killed.

536
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,826
Hey, give me a hand with this thing.

537
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,497
I gotta go help Ben with the television.

538
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,495
Don't be afraid of me.

539
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:49,249
I'm Helen Cooper, Harry's wife.

540
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,756
This place is ridiculous.

541
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,933
Look at this.
There's a million weak spots up here.

542
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,096
Give me one of those.

543
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,193
Her brother was killed.

544
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,198
And they talk about these windows.

545
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,242
I can't see a damned thing.

546
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,825
There could be 15 million
of those things out there.

547
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,002
That's how much good these windows are.

548
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,960
Why don't you do something to help somebody?

549
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,717
Here, I have it.
Drag a couple of those chairs together.

550
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,894
There's a socket over here.

551
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,272
Now, you'd better watch this
and try to understand what's going on.

552
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,150
I don't want anyone's life on my hands.

553
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,732
Is there anything I can do to help?

554
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,692
I don't want to hear
any more from you, mister.

555
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,947
If you stay up here, you take orders from me!

556
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,779
And that includes leaving the girl alone.

557
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,412
- It's on! It's on!
- There's no sound.

558
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,368
Play with the rabbit ears.

559
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,416
<i>Reports, incredible as they seem,</i>

560
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,999
<i>are not the results of mass hysteria.</i>

561
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,209
Mass hysteria.

562
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,169
What do they think, we're imagining all this?

563
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,298
Shut up.

564
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,130
<i>In all parts of the country.</i>

565
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,136
<i>The wave of murder which is sweeping
the eastern third of the nation</i>

566
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:31,097
<i>is being committed by creatures
who feast upon the flesh of their victims.</i>

567
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,433
<i>First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development</i>

568
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:39,147
<i>came from people who were understandably
frightened and almost incoherent.</i>

569
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,735
<i>Officials and newsmen at first discounted
those eyewitness descriptions</i>

570
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,656
<i>as being beyond belief.</i>

571
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,950
<i>However, the reports persisted.</i>

572
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,658
<i>Medical examinations of some of the victims</i>

573
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,961
<i>bore out the fact
that they had been partially devoured.</i>

574
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,169
<i>I think we have some late word just arriving,</i>

575
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,297
<i>and we interrupt to bring this to you.</i>

576
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,631
<i>This is the latest disclosure in a report</i>

577
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,432
<i>from National Civil Defense headquarters
in Washington.</i>

578
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,974
<i>It has been established
that persons who have recently died</i>

579
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,684
<i>have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.</i>

580
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,731
<i>A widespread investigation
of reports from funeral homes,</i>

581
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,483
<i>morgues, and hospitals</i>

582
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:25,529
<i>has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life</i>

583
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,987
<i>and seeking human victims.</i>

584
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,410
<i>It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,</i>

585
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,493
<i>but it does seem to be a fact.</i>

586
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,370
<i>When this emergency first began,</i>

587
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,793
<i>radio and television
was advising people to stay inside,</i>

588
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,045
<i>behind locked doors, for safety.</i>

589
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,423
<i>Well, that situation has now changed.</i>

590
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:47,843
<i>We're able to report
a definite course of action for you.</i>

591
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,387
<i>Civil defense machinery has been organized</i>

592
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,391
<i>to provide rescue stations
with food, shelter, medical treatment,</i>

593
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,060
<i>and protection by armed national guardsmen.</i>

594
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,606
<i>Stay tuned to the broadcasting stations
in your local area</i>

595
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,689
<i>for this list of rescue stations.</i>

596
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,775
<i>This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.</i>

597
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,986
<i>Look for the name
of the rescue station nearest you</i>

598
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,534
<i>and make your way to that location
as soon as possible.</i>

599
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,368
So we have that truck. If we can get
some gas, we can get outta here.

600
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,248
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

601
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,875
But it's locked.

602
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,169
<i>...emergency meeting called
this afternoon by the president.</i>

603
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:25,213
<i>Since convening,

604
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,797
<i>the FBI, the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA</i>

605
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,258
<i>has not produced any public information.</i>

607
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,895
<i>So far, all the betting
on the answer to that question</i>

608
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,854
<i>centers on the recent explorer satellite
shot to Venus.</i>

609
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:48,946
<i>That satellite, you recall,
started back to Earth, but never got here.</i>

610
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,989
<i>That's the space vehicle which orbited Venus</i>

611
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,867
<i>and then was purposely destroyed by NASA</i>

612
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,869
<i>when scientists discovered it was carrying</i>

613
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,789
<i>a mysterious, high-level radiation with it.</i>

614
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,541
<i>Could that radiation be somehow responsible</i>

615
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,461
<i>for the wholesale murders
we're now suffering?</i>

616
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,881
<i>Newsman Don Quinn in Washington
has posed those questions.</i>

617
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,634
It's obvious.
Our best move is to try to get out of here.

618
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,263
- How are you gonna get over to that pump?
- Look!

619
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,012
<i>You're coming from a meeting regarding
the explosion of the Venus probe.</i>

620
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,597
<i>Is that right?</i>

621
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,557
<i>Yes, yes,
that was the subject of the meeting.</i>

622
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,355
<i>Do you feel there is a connection
between this and the phenomenon...</i>

623
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,024
<i>There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.</i>

624
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,402
<i>In other words, you feel that
the radiation on the Venus probe</i>

625
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,070
<i>is enough to cause these mutations?</i>

626
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,823
<i>- There was a very high degree of radiation.
- Well, just a minute.</i>

627
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,701
<i>I'm not sure that that's certain at all.
I don't think that has been...</i>

628
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,578
<i>It's the only logical explanation
that we have at this time.</i>

629
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,786
<i>In other words,
it is the military's viewpoint that this...</i>

630
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,997
<i>the radiation
is not the cause of the mutation.</i>

631
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,459
<i>I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.</i>

632
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,794
<i>I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,</i>

633
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,800
<i>until we... until this is irrefutably proved.</i>

634
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,052
<i>Everything is being done that can be done.</i>

635
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,430
<i>We'll have to hurry for our next meeting.</i>

636
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,972
<i>Professor, you feel that there is
a definite connection between...</i>

637
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,894
<i>A definite connection
as far as Dr. Keller and myself...</i>

638
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,523
<i>Doctor, please. I thought
we decided that is not proved yet.</i>

639
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,482
<i>Was it... Was the satellite...
When the satellite was exploded...</i>

640
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,567
<i>It was an unusual amount of radiation,</i>

641
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,364
<i>enough to cause mutation
under certain circumstances.</i>

642
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,783
<i>Could have happened to have a bearing on it.</i>

643
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,077
<i>It does seem to have a bearing on it.</i>

644
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,911
<i>- Will there be a reply for the...</i>
<i>- Later.</i>

645
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,415
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- There will be a reply?</i>

646
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:25,498
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Later this afternoon?</i>

647
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,337
<i>There will be a report this afternoon?</i>

648
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,670
<i>- Perhaps there will be a report later.</i>
<i>- Yes. Yes.</i>

649
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,255
<i>Will you close the window?</i>

650
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,137
<i>We are doing everything possible
to solve the problem.</i>

651
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:42,309
<i>We're hoping to get some
further explanation of this...</i>

652
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,767
We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.

653
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,814
He said the rescue stations
have doctors and medical supplies.

654
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,317
If we could get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

655
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,611
<i>...is one of the world's foremost authorities</i>

656
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,694
<i>on space science and technology.</i>

657
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,990
Willard. I saw a sign that said Willard.

658
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,367
It's only about 17 miles from here.

659
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,411
You know this area. Are you from around here?

660
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,455
Judy and I are both from around here.

661
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,707
We were on our way up to the lake
to go swimming.

662
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,835
And Judy had a radio,
and we heard the first reports about this.

663
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,962
So we knew the old house was here
and we came in

664
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,256
and found the lady upstairs, dead.

665
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,963
Then these other people came.

666
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,344
We went down into the basement
and put a bar across the door,

667
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:18,926
and it is pretty strong.

668
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,387
How could we possibly get away from here?

669
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,972
We've got a sick child, two women,

670
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,682
one woman out of her head,

671
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,814
three men, and the place
is surrounded with these things.

672
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,818
<i>Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,</i>

673
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,650
<i>has been working very hard</i>

674
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:38,156
<i>to find some solution
to these things that are happening.</i>

675
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,239
<i>Do you have any answers at this time?</i>

676
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,160
<i>Yes, we have some answers.</i>

677
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,914
<i>But first let me stress the importance
of seeking medical attention</i>

678
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,083
<i>for anyone who's been injured in any way.</i>

679
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:52,418
<i>We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.</i>

680
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,968
How bad has your kid been hurt?

681
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,632
Um...

682
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,888
Look, you go down there and tell... Judy?

683
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:05,433
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here,
and you stay with the kid, all right?

684
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,979
<i>Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.</i>

685
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,481
<i>In the cold room at the university,</i>

686
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,063
<i>we had a cadaver.</i>

687
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:17,445
<i>A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.</i>

688
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,489
<i>Sometime early this morning,</i>

689
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,742
<i>it opened its eyes
and began to move its trunk.</i>

690
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:26,042
<i>It was dead,
but it opened its eyes and tried to move.</i>

691
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,832
They want you upstairs. Did she ask for me?

692
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,379
She hasn't said anything.

693
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,462
I don't understand.

694
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,224
Baby? It's Mommy.

695
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,721
I hurt.

696
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,514
I'll come back down
as soon as I find out what they want.

697
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,440
Thank you, Judy.

698
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,105
<i>The bodies should be disposed of at once,</i>

699
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,982
<i>preferably by cremation.</i>

700
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,689
<i>Well, how long after death, then,</i>

701
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,649
<i>does the body become reactivated?</i>

702
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,404
<i>It's only a matter of minutes.</i>

703
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,199
<i>Minutes? Well, that doesn't give people
time to make any arrangements.</i>

704
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,744
<i>No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.</i>

705
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:10,205
<i>The bodies must be carried
to the street and... and burned.</i>

706
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,958
<i>They must be burned immediately.</i>

707
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,502
<i>Soak them with gasoline and burn them.</i>

708
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,961
<i>The bereaved will have to forgo
the dubious comforts</i>

709
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,508
<i>that a funeral service will give.</i>

710
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,832
<i>They're just dead flesh, and dangerous.</i>

711
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:28,975
Judy, I need you to find some bedspreads
or sheets to tear up into small strips, okay?

712
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,058
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

713
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,644
We need some bottles or jars
to make Molotov cocktails

714
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,354
to hold them off while we try to escape.

715
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,484
Hey, there's a big can
of kerosene down there.

716
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,278
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

717
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,155
There's a big key ring down there.

718
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,324
There may be a key to the gas pump on it.

719
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:45,992
I'll check.

720
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,870
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

721
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,248
Meantime, a couple of us
can go out and try to get the gas,

722
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,916
then come back for the rest of the people.

723
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,793
But that'll leave a door open someplace.

724
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,921
Yeah, that's right. It better be this door.

725
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,129
It's closer to the truck.

726
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,801
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

727
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,970
While we're gone,
the rest of you can hole up in there.

728
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,138
I found some fruit jars in the cellar.

729
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,972
And there's a key on here
that's labeled for the gas pump out back.

730
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,518
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

731
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,862
I can handle the truck, no sweat.

732
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,406
You're it then. You and I will go.

733
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:32,122
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

734
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,667
You can go upstairs
and toss the cocktails from a window.

735
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:38,000
Tom, you and I will have
to unboard this door.

736
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,962
After you toss the cocktails,
you hustle back down here and lock this door.

737
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:45,015
It's no good to board it up
because we'll have to get back in quickly.

738
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,719
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

739
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,180
then we'll worry
about getting everybody into the truck.

740
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,764
Now, let's move it.

741
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,684
<i>No place to flee for safety,</i>

742
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,315
<i>except for the rescue stations
which have been set up.</i>

743
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,735
<i>Indications are
that before this emergency is over,</i>

744
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:05,740
<i>we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.</i>

745
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,497
You always have a smile for me.

746
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,253
How can you smile like that all the time?

747
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,878
How many do you have done?

748
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,803
Come on, honey. We gotta move.

749
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:32,057
- Tom, are you sure about the phone?
- The phone is dead out.

750
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,231
All you get is a recorded message.

751
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,685
If I could only call the folks.
They're going to be so worried about us.

752
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,897
Everything'll be all right.

753
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,904
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll
call them. They might even be there.

754
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,694
I know.

755
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,783
- Tom?
- Hmm.

756
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,790
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing, Tom?

757
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,042
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

758
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,836
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

759
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,668
We've got to get to a rescue station.

760
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,299
- I don't know.
- Come on, honey.

761
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,131
You're starting to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

762
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,091
But why do you have to go out there?

763
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:14,055
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

764
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,105
Ben doesn't know anything about that stuff.

765
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,563
- But we're safe in here.
- For how long, honey?

766
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,771
We're safe now.

767
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,943
But there's gonna be more and more
of those things.

768
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:27,026
I know. I know all that.

769
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,410
Hey. Listen.

770
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,037
Remember when we had the big flood?

771
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:39,838
Remember how difficult it was for us
to convince you that it was right to leave?

772
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:43,375
Remember?
Remember we had to go to Willard then?

773
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,836
This isn't a passing thing, honey.

774
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:49,634
It... It's not like
just a wind passing through.

775
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,308
We've got to do something, and fast.

776
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,020
I just don't want you to go out there,
that's all.

777
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,772
Hey.

778
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,024
Smile, honey.

779
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,107
Where's that big smile for me?

780
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,361
Boy.

781
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,033
You sure are no use at all, are you?

782
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,661
We've got work to do, honey.

783
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,368
And you... you...

784
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:36,890
We better get her downstairs.

785
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,598
We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.

786
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,521
She's right. You have to go downstairs now.

787
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,730
Just for a little while, until we get back.

788
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,735
Then we can all leave.

789
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:51,239
Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.

790
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,764
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

791
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,018
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.

792
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,896
Okay, toss 'em!

793
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,442
Go ahead! Go on!

794
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,955
- I'm going with him.
- Get back in the cellar!

795
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,254
- No!
- It's too late. Too late!

796
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,593
Well, is she coming? Come on.

797
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,426
Get in!

798
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,920
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

799
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,218
Watch it.

800
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,217
Watch the torch!

801
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,017
We've gotta get away from the pump!

802
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,913
Hang on!

803
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,663
Tom! Tom, you guys need
to get out of the truck!

804
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,605
Come on. Let's get outta here.

805
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,855
- Come on, come on!
- My jacket's caught.

806
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:44,050
Let me in! Let me in!

807
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,342
Cooper!

808
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,514
Cooper!

809
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,831
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things!

810
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,044
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

811
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:33,548
There's supposed to be another broadcast
at three o'clock.

812
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,884
Ten minutes.

813
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:39,721
Oh. Only 10 more minutes?

814
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,683
We don't have very long to wait.

815
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,563
We can leave.

816
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:48,271
Well, we'd better leave soon.

817
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,448
It's 10 minutes to 3:00.

818
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:59,828
You know anything about this area at all?
I mean, is Willard the nearest town?

819
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,169
I don't know.

820
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,749
We were...

821
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,346
just trying to get to a motel before dark.

822
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,550
You said those things turned your car over.

823
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,430
You think we can get it back
on its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

824
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,475
Seems like it was pretty far away.

825
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,353
Seems like we ran.

826
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,192
Forget it. It's at least a mile.

827
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,608
Johnny has the keys.

828
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:33,778
You're going to carry that child a mile?
Through that army of things out there?

829
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:37,362
I can carry the kid.
What's wrong with her? How'd she get hurt?

830
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:41,999
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

831
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,164
What's wrong?

832
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:48,959
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

833
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,633
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

834
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,920
She can't walk. She's too weak.

835
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:01,680
- Well, one of us could try to get to the car.
- You gonna turn it over by yourself?

836
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,014
You can't start the car. Johnny has the keys.

837
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,563
You have a car? Where? Where is it?

838
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:14,023
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

839
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,200
But where is it?

840
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,914
Good Lord.

841
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,884
<i>...being monitored closely by scientists</i>

842
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,971

845
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,688
<i>So long as this situation remains,</i>

846
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,735

847
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:59,405
<i>to be transformed

852
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:16,502
<i>from covering such a search-and-destroy
operation against the ghouls,</i>

<i>in Butler County, Pennsylvania.</i>

855
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,637
<i>So now let's go to that filmed report.</i>

856
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:26,432
<i>All law enforcement agencies and the military</i>

857
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:30,603
<i>have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.</i>

858
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:33,772
<i>The survival command center
at the Pentagon has disclosed</i>

859
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:38,027
<i>that a ghoul can be killed
by a shot in the head</i>

860
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,696
<i>or a heavy blow to the skull.</i>

861
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,653
<i>Officials are quoted as explaining</i>

862
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:46,535
<i>that since the brain of a ghoul
has been activated by the radiation,</i>

863
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:50,961
<i>the plan is,
kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.</i>

864
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:55,336
<i>- Want anything from the supply wagon, Kus?</i>
<i>- Uh, no, we're all right.</i>

865
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,793
<i>Okay.</i>

866
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,173
<i>Hey, Cass,
put that thing all the way in the fire.</i>

867
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,631
<i>- We don't want it getting up again.</i>
<i>- All right. I gotcha.</i>

868
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,842
<i>Chief McClelland, how is everything going?</i>

869
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:07,348
<i>Ah, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.</i>

870
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:10,017
<i>You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.</i>

871
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:12,519
<i>Chief, do you think we'll be able
to defeat these things?</i>

872
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:15,189
<i>Well, we killed 19 of them today,
right in this area.</i>

873
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,523
<i>Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.</i>

874
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:20,608
<i>They must have thought somebody was in there.</i>

875
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,069
<i>There wasn't though.
We heard 'em making all kind of noise.</i>

876
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,616
<i>We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.</i>

877
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:27,868
<i>Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?</i>

878
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,161
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

879
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,744
<i>Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,</i>

880
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,454
<i>would I stand a chance with them?</i>

881
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,834
<i>Well, there's no problem.
If you had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.</i>

882
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,416
<i>That's a sure way to kill 'em.</i>

883
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,127
<i>If you don't, get yourself a club or a torch.
Beat 'em or burn 'em.</i>

884
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,712
<i>They go up pretty easy.</i>

885
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:44,298
<i>Well, Chief McClelland,
how long do you think it will take you</i>

886
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,384
<i>until you get the situation under control?</i>

887
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:49,265
<i>Well, that's pretty hard to say.
We don't know how many of 'em there are.</i>

888
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,973
<i>We know when we find 'em, we can kill 'em.</i>

889
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,979
<i>- Are they slow-moving, Chief?</i>
<i>- Yeah, they're dead.</i>

890
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,897
<i>They're all messed up.</i>

891
01:20:56,977 --> 01:21:01,318
<i>Well, in time, would you say you oughta
be able to wrap this up in 24 hours?</i>

892
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:04,026
<i>Well, we don't really know.</i>

893
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:07,613
<i>We know we'll be into it most of the night,
probably into the early morning.</i>

894
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,323
<i>We're working our way toward Willard,</i>

895

<i>and we'll team up
with the National Guard over there,</i>

896
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,620
<i>and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.</i>

897
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,329
<i>Thank you very much, Chief McClelland.</i>

900

<i>Official spokesmen declined to speculate

902

- Is the fuse box in the cellar?
- I don't know. I...

903

I... It isn't the fuse.

904

01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:56,290
Haven't you had enough?

907
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,918
Well, two people are dead already
on account of that guy.

908
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,001
Take a look out that window. Look at...

909
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:01,685
Get over here, man!

910
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,897
Come on!

911
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,294
Go ahead. Go ahead.

912
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:26,547
You wanna stay up here now?

913
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:28,425
Helen, get in the cellar.

914
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,383
Get in the cellar now. Move!

915
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:12,111
No! No!

916
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,405
Karen?

917
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:19,489
Karen?

918
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,077
Karen.

919
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,041
Poor baby.

920
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,099
Baby.

921
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,968
No! No!

922
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,848
No! No! No!

923
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,934
No!

924
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:31,815
No! Get out!

925
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,734
No! No, Johnny!

926
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:39,070
No!

927
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,280
No, no!

928
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,785
Oh, help me, help me.

929
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,367
Oh!

930
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:22,063
Hey, Vince, Al, you wanna get about
four or five men and a couple dogs?

931
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,146
There's a house over here behind those trees.

932
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:26,983
We wanna go check it out.
You still here, Bill?

933
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:30,069
Yeah, Chief, we're going to stay with it
till we meet up with the National Guard.

934
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,028
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

935
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:34,159
- You're doing all the work. You take it.
- Thank you.

936
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,661
We should be wrapped up here
about three or four more hours.

937
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,368
We'll probably get into Willard then.

938
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,874
I guess you can go over there
and meet the National Guard.

939
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:43,293
Nick, you and the rest of these men
wanna come with me?

940
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:45,545
Bill, I'm gonna check the office,
see what's happening.

941
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:48,048
All right, Steve.
Tell 'em we're going to stay with it

942
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:51,301
and everything appears to be under control.

943
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:43,478
They need you down there by the barn.

944
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,060
Okay.

945
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:49,398
Some of you guys can follow the wagon down.

946
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,326
I only need a few men to check out the house.

947
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:58,835
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.

948
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:39,406
He's a dead one. Get up here!

949
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:42,660
Nick! Tony! Steve!

950
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,166
You wanna get out in that field
and build me a bonfire.

951
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,594
You, drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

952
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,223
- Nothing down here.
- All right.

953
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,931
Go ahead down and give 'em a hand.
Let's go check out the house.

954
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:07,017
There's something there. I heard a noise.

955
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:14,362
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head,
right between the eyes.

956
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21,242
Good shot. Okay, he's dead. Let's go get him.

957
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:23,497
That's another one for the fire.

958
01:34:44,387 --> 01:34:48,728
All right, send a wagon
through directly. Over.

959
01:34:54,362 --> 01:34:57,067
Keep those dogs back off of those things.

960
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:01,384
Come ahead with the motorcycle, please.

961
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,966
Let's go!

962
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:05,097
That's the way!

963
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:08,600
Hey, Randy, light these torches over here.

964
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,557
Get those people in the back.
Way in the back.

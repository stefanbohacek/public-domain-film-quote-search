[tense music]

Don't move.

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,110
Stay there now.

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,060
Steady.

8
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,150
Now, sit up!

Get up!

- Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,030
Please let me help you.

Oh Buzz!

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,060
Buzz!
- Take it easy.

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,290
- [Buzz] What's the matter?

28
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,290
- Look!

29
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,240
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,220
- Take it away.

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,280
Not here.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,160
- Wait a minute, take
it easy, Stanley.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,170
This is a harmless
little kitten.

34
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,000
- Buzz, I'm scared of that.
[cat meows]

Ooh, the wild look in his face!

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,070
- Oh.

37
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,150
I can't understand why you have

38
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,260
this terrible fear
of animals in you!

39
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,120
What is it?

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,250
- When I was a little baby I
was scared by my piggy bank.

41
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,070
- Oh, that's nonsense.

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,110
- You wanna hear
something worse?

43
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,260
- What?

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,010
- I was 15 years old before I
ate my first animal cracker.

[phone ringing]

Get to work.
[cat meows]

And how.

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,110
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,230
That's the truth.

53
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,030
- How do you do, may I help you?

54
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,020
- Do you happen
to have a copy of

55
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,160
"Dark Safari" by Cuddleferd?

56
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,070
- I'll find out.

57
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,290
- [Customer] Hey bub.

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,270
- How do you do, gentlemen?

59
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,210
- [Customer] We'd like
speak to salesman, pal.

60
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,260
- Well, I'm the salesman,
Stanley Livington.

61
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm the clerk in charge
of all jungle books.

62
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,270
And at 11 o'clock
I'm giving a lecture.

63
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,250
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,000
You got a book by the name of-

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,140
- "Dark Safari" by Cuddleferd.

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,120
- "Dark Safari" by Cuddleferd.

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,050
We did have it, but we got
rid of it sometime ago.

68
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,250
I wanna tell you,
gentlemen, I read that book.

69
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,280
I had nightmares
for nine months.

[books thudding]

71
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,140
- How well do you
remember that book?

72
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,120
- Why?

73
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,230
- Do you remember a map in it?

74
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,200
- The map in that book?

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,270
Of course I remember it.

76
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,020
- Could you draw it?

77
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,270
- Could I draw it?

78
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,170
- For $1,000?

79
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,160
- Draw that map in
that book for $1,000?

80
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,240
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,170
- For $1,000, I could
draw that map in oil.

82
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,030
- Okay, then meet us in
the alley tonight at 7:30.

83
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,180
- And we'll take you to somebody

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,070
who will give you $1,000 the
minute you lay down the pencil.

85
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,260
Is it a deal?

86
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,030
- Shake.

[bones cracking]

00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,010
Oh.
- Okay, pal.

89
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,010
- [Man] See you in the
ally tonight at 7:30.

90
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,090
- And be there chum.

91
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,040
Get me?

92
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,000
- $1,000 to draw that map.

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,070
- I'm sorry but that
book is out of print.

94
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,060
In fact we sold the
last one some time ago.

95
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,200
- Oh dear, I was afraid of that.

96
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,260
I've been to every
bookstore in the city.

97
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,250
There's a map in that book
that I'd give $2,500 for.

98
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,190
- Will you give me
that again please?

99
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,260
- I said there was
a map in that book

100
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,270
that I'd get $2,500 for.

101
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,220
- $2,500?

102
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,140
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

103
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,160
What are you doing?

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,150
- Hey Buzz, this
you'll never believe.

105
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,100
There were two guys in here-

106
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,240
- Look I understand.

107
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,220
Look Stanley, how well
do you remember that book

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,180
you read about "Dark Safari"?

109
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,160
- That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,230
There was two guys in here-

111
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,200
- Now look, you remember
that was a map in it?

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,180
- You too?

113
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,260
No, go away, go away, go away.

114
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,240
- What are you doing there?

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,000
- I'm drawing that map now.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,180
- Oh, no you don't.
- Wait a minute.

117
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,160
- [Buzz] No, you
can't draw that-

118
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,100
- Buzz, don't tear that up!

119
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,080
I got a chance to make-

120
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,170
- Sh, wait, quiet, quiet.

121
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,050
Come on, follow me.

122
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,290
Take it easy, take it easy.

123
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,090
Madam, you are the
luckiest person

124
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,250
in New York this morning.

125
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,180
Allow me to introduce
Stanley Livington,

126
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,290
one of the world's
greatest wild game hunters.

127
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,110
- Oh, no.
- Well how exciting.

128
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,040
- [Diana] Wild game
hunters are my weakness.

129
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,000
This is really a
thrill, Mr. Livington.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
- So nice meeting you
too but I'm really not-

131
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,150
- It might address
you to know that

132
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,090
when Mr. Cuddleferd
wrote "Dark Safari",

133
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,230
Mr. Livington was right there.

134
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,180
- Oh-

135
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,160
- Wonderful!

136
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
Then you must be very familiar

137
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,200
with the map that
is in that book.

138
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,150
- A map?

139
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,100
- Yes.

140
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,080
- Oh sure.

141
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,150
That's one map I could draw

142
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,200
in a dark room even
without a pencil.

143
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,020
- You see, your
troubles are all over.

144
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,110
I could make arrangements
to bring him over

145
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,160
to your home this evening.

146
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,220
- Oh, marvelous.
- No, no.

147
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,000
- [Diana] I think
it's a wonderful idea.

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,180
My name is Emerson,
Diana Emerson.

149
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,010
- How do you do,
Miss Emerson, but no.

150
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,050
I got a date in the alley.

151
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,010
- She'll have to wait.

152
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,260
- She'll have to wait.

153
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,190
- Here's my address.

154
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,280
See you tonight then.

155
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
Goodbye.

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,250
- Goodbye.

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,150
That's the kind of
girl I dream about,

158
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,140
but you should see the
ones I get [whistles].

159
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,000
- I tell you, boss, the guy
said he knew the map backwards.

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,100
So we make a date to meet him,

161
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,250
bring him in, have him draw it.

162
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,140
- Yeah and the little
muzzler never shows up

163
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
after us offering him a grand.

164
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,200
- Well you can relax.

165
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,100
I found somebody
myself this morning.

166
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,110
- You did, boss?

167
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,170
Where?

168
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,150
- [Diana] The Kloppers
Department store.

169
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,040
- That's where we found our guy.

170
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,140
- Wait a minute.

171
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,120
Was he a silly-looking
little fat guy?

172
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,220
- [Man] That's him.

173
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,270
- Why that two-timer!

174
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,130
You offer him 1,000 and he
holds out for a higher price.

175
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,230
- The minute he put his
foot through the door,

176
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,040
I'll break every
bone in his hand.

177
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,230
- You'll do no such thing.

178
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,100
When he leaves, you boys
can meet him outside

179
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,240
and get my money back.

180
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,230
- We get you, boss.

181
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,260
- Now go out the side entrance.

182
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
I'm closing a deal with the man

183
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,060
who's gonna lead the safari.

184
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,140
Won't you come in, Mr. Beatty?

185
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,250
[perky music]

186
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,200
- This is the place.

187
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,050
Now don't forget she thinks
you're a big game hunter.

188
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,060
- Buzz, why do you keep
getting me in the middle?

189
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,030
I wish you hadn't.

190
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,260
- Why you ingrate.

191
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,270
Here I'm giving you a
chance to make me $2,500.

192
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,040
Is that the way you
want to repay me

193
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,030
for all the things I
could've done for you?

194
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,280
Come on.

195
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,200
- I'm sorry.

196
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,270
- Oh, come on.

197
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,120
[perky music]

198
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,180
Stanley, will you come on?

199
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,050
- I'm shutting off the water.

200
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,220
- Well turn it off and come on.

201
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,110
- [Stanley] I stopped it.

202
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,100
- Good, come on up here.

203
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,000
- [Stanley] May I see
you a minute please?

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,150
[perky music]

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,180
- Now what's the matter?

206
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,200
- My finger's stuck.

207
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
- Leave it there and come on.

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,250
- Okay.

209
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,240
- What's the matter?

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
Let me see this.

211
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,090
- Not that one, not that one.

212
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,220
Not that one!
- Shh!

213
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,240
- [Stanley] That one!

214
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,220
- [Buzz] Don't holler.

215
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,060
- Don't pull at that one!

216
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,190
- [Buzz] Shh, wait a
minute, just wait a minute.

217
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,220
- Harry, did you
answer the door?

218
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,170
- No.

219
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,140
Do I have to?

220
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,220
- Answer the door.

221
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,020
- Oh.

222
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,270
All right.

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
Do everything around here.

224
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,010
Get this off.

225
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,010
It's tight.

226
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,050
I gotta be a cook and a butler.

227
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,070
One of these days I'll just...

228
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,220
Well, that's all.

229
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,020
I'll just do it.

230
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,100
[door knocking]

231
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,250
Yes?

232
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,170
- [Buzz] Mr. Johnson and Mr.
Livington to see Miss Emerson.

233
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,240
- Well come in.

234
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,260
[metal knocking]

235
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,170
Oh, who is knocking?

236
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,200
Well come in!

237
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,090
Miss Emerson is
busy for the moment.

238
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,150
Will you step in the
living room please?

239
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,100
Hats.

240
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,060
- Thank you.

241
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,180
- [Harry] Ow, that hurts.

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,020
- That belongs on outside.

243
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,160
- Yeah, I can't get it off.

244
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,040
Help me get it off.

245
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,060
- Will you get your hand-

246
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,130
- Well not so hard.

247
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,160
- Well get your hand
out, I'll pull it out.

248
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,290
Get your hand out of the way.

249
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,080
Now get your hand
out of the way.

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,070
Move your hand out

251
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,140
of the way.
- Get it off!

252
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,040
Well get your hand
out of the way,

253
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,180
I'll get it off.

254
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,280
- Naturally I haven't
publicized the expedition

255
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,110
because I could easily
become the victim

256
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,260
of unscrupulous people.

257
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,050
- [Clyde] If that map's one
of the few in existence,

258
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,120
the owner would
practically have you

259
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,260
in the palm of his hand.

260
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,290
- This man coming tonight
is the gullible type,

261
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,280
but fairly intelligent.

262
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,120
If he can remember
the map accurately,

263
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,260
we'll proceed at once.

264
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,220
- [Clyde] That'll be fine
with me, Miss Emerson.

265
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,160
- And now regarding your fee.

266
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,050
Suppose we say 5000 in advance
and 15,000 on completion?

267
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,200
- That's very liberal.

268
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,040
- On the contrary,
money is no object

269
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,180
as long as I get what I'm after.

270
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,080
- Come on, will you?

271
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,000
- Aha, there it is.

272
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,150
- Oh, not that hand, this one!

273
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,110
- [Stanley] Well put
this hand in your pocket!

274
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,250
Ooh.

275
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,110
Get your hand out of there!

276
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,060
Oh.

277
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,260
[water splashes]

278
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,090
- Ooh, sometimes!

279
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,010
- Stanley.

280
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,190
I just found out that
map is worth more

281
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,100
than $2,500 to that woman.

282
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,250
- I can't get over it.

283
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,200
All I did was go like this
and the water came out.

284
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,110
- Are you listening?

285
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,060
Come on.

286
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,030
Come on!

287
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,110
You go in the living
room and wait.

288
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,190
I'm gonna snoop around here

289
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,030
and find out more
about this deal.

290
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,270
Go ahead.

291
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,160
- Who was at the door, Harry?

292
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,110
- Mr. Livington and Mr. Johnson.

293
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,100
- Good, where are they?

294
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,130
- They're in the living room.

295
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,190
- I'll see them in a minute

296
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,100
and we'll have coffee
in the library.

297
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,120
Harry, I'm phoning
Gunner to come over.

298
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,290
Please leave the door open.

299
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,180
- [Harry] Yes ma'am.

300
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,090
- Excuse me.

301
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,060
I didn't know there was
anybody in the room.

302
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,050
I'm awfully sorry.

303
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,010
Say hold it right where you are.

304
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,130
You know you standing in
front of this here picture

305
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,190
reminds me of my last
expedition in Africa?

306
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,230
- Is that so?

307
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,180
- Yes indeedy.

308
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,220
Yes indeedy.

309
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,000
And it was my
dangerous expedition.

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,060
We were at the cats.

311
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,120
Big cats, you know
what cats are?

312
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,180
- Lions, I imagine.

313
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,120
- Oh, there's no imagine
about it, my friend.

314
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,170
Lions are lions here or
any place, they're lions.

315
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,280
You can't imagine they're lions.

316
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,050
Oh no indeedy.

317
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,110
I wanna tell you something.

318
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,130
My first afternoon
out I bagged 64 lions.

319
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,070
Gad, what a hunt.

320
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,020
- Really?

321
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,170
- Oh yes.

322
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,140
And then I ran into an old
friend of mine, Clyde Beatty.

323
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,090
- No?

324
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,220
- Yeah and was he hurt.

325
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,070
He didn't bag a
lion for two weeks!

326
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,250
- Really?
[Stanley laughs]

327
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,240
- I bagged 'em all!

328
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,190
He couldn't get one of 'em!

329
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,030
Course when it comes
to handling lions,

330
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,210
he don't know from nothing.

331
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,030
I am the boy right over here.

332
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,240
I wanna tell you something
else too between you and I.

333
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,080
Clyde Beatty is a phony.

334
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,100
On the side, a
pretty nice fella,

335
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,020
but between you and I a phony.

336
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,100
[Stanley chuckles]

337
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,280
Something else I wanna
tell you, friend.

338
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,070
Who do you think tames the lions

339
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,190
that he has inside the cages?

340
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,240
Me, Stanley Livington, the
world's greatest hunter!

341
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,010
- No kidding?
- Yes, sir.

342
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,280
- [Stanley] Well,
one of the greatest.

343
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,040
[Stanley laughs]

344
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,280
By the way, what's your name?

345
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,230
- Clyde Beatty.

346
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,210
- Clyde Beatty.

347
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,070
Clyde, it's nice knowing you.

348
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,210
I want you to stick around
because I'm gonna tell you

349
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,040
how I used to go in myself
and tame those lions.

350
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,090
Now when it comes to
taming the animals, Clyde.

351
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,080
Clyde!

352
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,030
Clyde!

353
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,230
[Stanley gasps]

354
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,250
- Oh, good evening.

355
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,140
I see you've met Mr. Livington,
our big wild game hunter eh.

356
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,100
- Yes indeed.

357
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,260
- Swell.

358
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,290
- He's just been telling me
about some of his exploits.

359
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,040
- Oh swell, swell, that's fine.

360
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,110
Tell him about the time you

361
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,250
and Clyde Beatty went
tiger hunting in India.

362
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,130
- Yes, I'd like
to hear about it.

363
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,290
- Yeah, yeah I'll do you one.

364
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,250
Stanley tells me that he out
shot Beatty be five to one.

365
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,020
[Stanley gasps]

366
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,090
By the way, I don't think

367
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,160
you've introduced me
to this gentleman.

368
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,110
- Clyde Beatty.

369
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,060
- Clyde Beatty.

370
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,200
[Buzz stutters]

371
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,150
Clyde Beatty, I'll
be seeing you around.

372
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,160
- Mr. Beatty, I'm sorry for
what I said about Mr. Beatty.

373
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,240
Excuse me.

374
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,020
- Why Mr. Johnson
and Mr. Livington,

375
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,280
please forgive me for
keeping you waiting.

376
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,120
You've met Mr. Beatty.

377
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,270
- It seems Mr. Livington
and I are old hunting pals.

378
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,050
- Won't you gentlemen
have some coffee?

379
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,270
And after coffee we'll have
Mr. Livington draw the map.

380
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,050
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

381
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,120
Mr. Livington will not
be able to draw the map.

382
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,190
- But he's got too.

383
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,090
The whole success of
my trip depends on it.

384
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,120
- You mean you intend to
take a trip to Africa?

385
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,070
- Very definitely.

386
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm planning a safari.

387
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,050
- I wonder if I may be excused.

388
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,100
I know you folks would rather
talk business in private.

389
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,200
- If you don't mind, it
think it would be better.

390
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,230
Mr. Beatty's hat, Harry.

391
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,090
Excuse me, gentlemen.

392
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,090
- Goodnight, old friend.

393
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,060
- Quick, Grapple and
Boots are outside waiting

394
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,160
to slug Johnson and Livington.

395
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,110
Tell them the plans have
changed and to lay off.

396
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,010
- Yes ma'am.

397
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,220
- Look Buzz, let
me draw the map.

398
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,170
We'll get the $2,500
and get out of here.

399
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,010
- Certainly not!

400
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,010
Now if I play your cards right,
we'll get more than $2,500.

401
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,110
Listen, you heard her.

402
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,050
She's organizing a safari.

403
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,000
- I wish I was there.

404
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,070
- Where?

405
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,090
- On the Hoboken
safari right now.

406
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,160
- Stanley, you're
absolutely right.

407
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,290
As you surmised and
to be frank with you,

408
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,270
I don't blame you for
having the desire.

409
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,090
- The desire to what?

410
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,050
- Of course I'll have to
explain everything to the lady.

411
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,240
- Explain it to me!

412
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,180
- Mr. Livington insists on
joining your safari to Africa.

413
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,020
- I insist?

414
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,230
- There you are, you heard
it from his own lips.

415
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,280
- Just a, hello.

416
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,150
Just a minute, how do you do?

417
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,240
- You see with Mr.
Livington in Africa,

418
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,200
he'd feel right at home
and it'd be very simple

419
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,220
for him to draw the map
without any difficulties.

420
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,020
- I think it's an
excellent idea.

421
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,170
- Surely.

422
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,230
- Once we're there, he can
lead us to the East Fork

423
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,090
of the Talabongo
and Okavangy River.

424
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,040
- Lead you to the fork?

425
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,120
- Yes, surely of course.

426
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,170
It'll be the regular
$5,000 fee in advance

427
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,150
and $15,000 on completion.

428
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,260
Of course that
includes my services.

429
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,030
- Splendid.
- That's fine.

430
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,100
- [Diana] And for
your safety I'm going

431
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,170
to assign you my
best follow upper.

432
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,020
- Follow upper?
- Follow upper?

433
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,230
- [Diana] Yes, he's the man
who follows you in the jungle

434
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,090
and if you miss a shot
at a charging animal,

435
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,130
he shoots and saves your life.

436
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,210
[door crashing]

437
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,150
Oh, that's him now.

438
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,100
Excuse me.

439
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,070
- [Buzz] Surely.

440
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,190
- Listen, Buzz, I'm not
gonna go over there.

441
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,220
You got no right to book
me in a thing like that.

442
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,000
- All this kind of money.

443
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,200
- You're always putting
me right in the middle-

444
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,270
- Don't tell me-

445
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,250
- Don't care what
kind of money it is!

446
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,230
- Don't you give me that line!

447
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,170
- Now listen, [speaks too fast]

448
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,010
- No more arguments.

449
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,050
- I'm not gonna go over
there with all those lions.

450
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,120
- Now, do as I tell you.
[Stanley roars]

451
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,190
- I'm gonna start
going the other way-

452
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,130
- You'll do as I
say, no arguments!

453
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,290
- Oh no, I'm not.

454
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,030
I won't.

455
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,200
- Gunner, I'd like
to have you meet

456
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,080
Mr. Johnson and Mr.
Livington, Gunner Jensen.

457
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,030
- Hi.

458
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,170
- I don't want to
seem inquisitive,

459
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,000
but just what are we
going to Africa for?

460
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,040
- Well, we're going after
an orangutan Gargantua.

461
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,160
- An orangutan Gargantua?

462
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,150
- Excuse me, please?

463
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,010
- Pardon me.
- May I see you?

464
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,260
- [Stanley] What's an
orangutan Gargantua?

465
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,130
- It's a big ape.

466
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,080
- Oh, a big ape.

467
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,190
- Yeah, stop worrying.

468
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,260
- Ape?

469
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,050
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Pardon me, pardon me.

470
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,190
- Big ape?
- Yeah.

471
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,170
- [Stanley] You mean like
the thing I seen in a circus,

472
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,240
like the father to the monkey?

473
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,270
- Yeah, it's only
bigger, bigger.

474
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,220
- Ping!

475
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,050
And he's gonna protect me?

476
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,000
- Mm-hm.

477
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,080
- Mm-hm.

478
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,060
- [Diana] Gunner,
show them how you

479
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,220
can shoot the Winchester.

480
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,210
[gunner crashing]

481
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,280
- You missed a lion.

482
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,040
I raise the gun to my shoulder,

483
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,030
look through the
peep sight and I...

484
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,140
I look through the peep sight,

485
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,220
put my finger on the trigger,

486
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,200
grab for the pump
slide, and I, I...

487
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,200
No pump slide.

488
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,120
- Stanley?

489
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,080
Stanley?
[perky music]

490
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,220
Now, where did he go?

491
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,170
Stanley!

492
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,110

[water splashes]

498
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,030
- It's a calm river.

499
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,090
You know, Stanley,

500
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,220
suppose a north
wind should come up?

501
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,200
What would you do?

502
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,280
- I'd throw out an anchor.

503
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,260
- If a west wind come
up, what would you do?

504
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,100
- I'd throw out another anchor.

505
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,110
- And a south wind came
up, what would you do then?

506
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,180
- I'd throw out another anchor!

507
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,290
- And an east wind blew
up, what would you do?

508
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,110
- I'd throw out another anchor!

509
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,180
- Where are you getting
all the anchors?

510
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,150
- The same place you're
getting all the wind!

511
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,000
- Will you keep quiet?

512
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,240
[tense music]
Come on, row your boat.

513
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,090
You've been a very bad boy
the last couple of days.

514
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,250
I want you to change,
I'm warning you.

515
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,200
I don't like it a bit.

516
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,100
All you do is snap at me!

517
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,220
- Me snap at you?

518
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,050
Oh, ain't that a laugh!

519
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,170
Me snapping at him!

520
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,120
- [Buzz] Why should you laugh?

521
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,190
- [Stanley] Oh.

522
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,160
[oar bouncing]

523
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,250

[tense perky music]

527
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,170
What are you doing?

528
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,210
[blender whirring]

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,130

[monkeys screeching]

531
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,280
- Say, you.
- What's the matter?

532
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,140
- [Harry] Oh, Gunner!

533
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,060
Look, not me, the post!

534
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,020
- Oh.

535
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,110
- Oh!

536
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,220
- Always complaining.

537
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,160
- [Man] Hello.

538
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,090
- [Diana] Hello.

539
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,000
- The camp's coming
along fine, Miss Emerson.

540
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,240
And in the morning, we'll
start for the interior.

541
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
- Very good.

542
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,020
- Well, we've looked
the whole place over.

543
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,000
You wanna know something, boss?

544
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,290
This don't look like a
place to find diamonds.

545
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,060
- You fool!
[face slaps]

546
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,110
Don't you ever mention
the word diamonds!

547
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,180
We're supposed to be
after an orangutan.

548
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,280
- And another thing, boss.

549
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,070
I'm getting awfully
sick of these

550
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,130
two guys you're depending on.

551
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,120
They're always fouling us up.

552
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,270
- Just be patient.

553
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,210
It won't be long now before
the map is in my hands.

554
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
- [Buzz] Stanley.

555
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,030
Stanley, drop everything!

556
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,260
- Huh?
- Drop everything!

557
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,030
- [Buzz] Come here,
come here Stanley.

558
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,260
Get up, get out
from under there.

559
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,150
Hurry up and come here.

560
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,220
Come on, Stanley.

561
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,020
- Oh Buzz, just when
I had the tent up!

562
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,090
- Never mind the tent.

563
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,090
Come over here,
and draw that map.

564
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,170
- The map?
- The map.

565
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,150
- [Stanley] If I draw it
will you let me go home?

566
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,230
- Why do you wanna go home?

567
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,080
- I forgot something.
- What did you forget?

568
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,230
- I forgot to stay there.
- Draw the map, come on.

569
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,220
- [Buzz] Boy, oh boy, can
you picture me a tycoon?

570
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, building, yachts, railroad.

571
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,030
I don't know, I might
even buy an airline,

572
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,110
according to how I feel.

573
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,210
My winters in Maine,
summers in Florida.

574
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,100
Oh, it's unbelievable.

575
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,230
- Look at him, he can't
even get his laundry up.

576
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,240
- Have you got it ready yet?

577
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,040
Come on!

578
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,290
You got it?

579
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,060
That a boy.

580
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
Oh, this paper here is
worth a million dollars.

581
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,200
- Million dollars?

582
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Well, I mean, I did it, I
got to have something for it.

583
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,060
- Oh, sure, sure.

584
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,050
I intended to.

585
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,170
Here, here's a nickel.

586
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,110
- Thank you.

587
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,060
- That a boy.

588
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,130
- Oh, a nickel!

589
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,180
- [Buzz] Hello, Diana.

590
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,050
- Harry, some tea
for Mr. Johnson.

591
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,120
- And plenty of sugar.

592
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,220
Wonderful day we're having.

593
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,000
You're looking
marvelous yourself.

594
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,060
- You're in fine spirits.

595
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,180
- I have all the reasons
in the world to be.

596
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,170
I've finally persuaded
Stanley to draw the map.

597
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,090
- Oh, well, may I see it?

598
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,180
- I also made some very
interesting discoveries.

599
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,050
Aside from the orangutan,

600
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,060
there are far more
important things

601
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,290
to be found in that
particular territory.

602
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,270
- Really?

603
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,040
- Yes, and due to the facts,

604
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,240
I personally think I'm
entitled to a new deal.

605
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,110
- Well, what kind of a
deal did you have in mind?

606
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:30,110
- Well, I'd say 20% of the
safari's profits would be fair.

607
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,130
- Very liberal.

608
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,230
In view of your generosity,
may I see the map?

609
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,240
- Oh, yeah, surely,
surely, surely.

610
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,020
Now, this map will
take you right to...

611
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,250
There seems to be
something lacking here.

612
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,260
I'll see Stanley.

613
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,110
There's some detail work,

614
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,240
he hasn't really
completed the map.

615
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,100
I'll be right back.

616
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,150
- Here's your tea, and I
put plenty of sugar in it.

617
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,220
- Drink it yourself!

618
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,210
- Oh, drink it yourself,
drink it yourself!

619
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,060
- Harry, I want to see Boots
and Grappler immediately.

620
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,230
- Come here, come
here, come here.

621
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,000
Wise aleck, huh?

622
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,140
- Now, what's the
matter with you?

623
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,290
- Thought you were putting
something over on me.

624
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,170
This is not the map that
was in Cuddleford's book.

625
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,240
- Oh, yes it is.

626
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,220
- This, this thing
tells you how to get

627
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,270
to Klopper's Department store.

628
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,040
- Well, that's the map.

629
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,200
I used to keep that map
in Cuddleford's book.

630
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,150
- Listen, you
nit-witted numbskull,

631
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,010
these people want a map
of the Bangi territory.

632
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,160
- The Bangi territory?

633
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,200
Bangi territory?

634
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,180
- Yes!

635
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,250
- I was wondering why they wanna

636
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,090
pay all that kind of
money just to find the

637
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,260
directions how I get to
Klopper's Department store.

638
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,040
That I couldn't understand.
- Just a minute,

639
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,180
- [Buzz] do you realize we're in

640
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,030
the most dangerous spot we've
ever been in in our lives?

641
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,280
- Dangerous spot?

642
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,260
- Dangerous spot!

643
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,120
- Buzz?
- What?

644
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
- [Stanley] Is it worse than
the time when Skinny Marink

645
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
knocked the chip
off my shoulder?

646
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,200
- Ah, certainly!

647
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,140
- Worse than that?
- I should say it is.

648
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,220
- [Stanley] And the time
I drew the line like that?

649
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,000
- Far more.

650
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,080
- Yeah, but that time
he came over the line.

651
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,140
It's worser than that?

652
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,210
- Never mind that,
it's worse than that.

653
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,040
- Oh, are we in trouble.

654
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,120
- Wait a minute, we've
got to do something.

655
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,280
I have it, we've gotta get out.

656
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,010
Come on, hurry up.
- Sure.

657
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,080
- [Grappler] What
ya doing, boys?

658
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,210
- Going somewhere, fellas?

659
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,190
- We were just gonna take these

660
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,210
little trunks inside the tent.

661
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,240
- Get moving.

662
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,170
- Hey.

663
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,070
Go ahead, knock the
chip off my shoulder.

664
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,120
- Not that, your head's
liable to go with it.

665
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,070
- Oh.

666
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,120
- Go on, get moving!

667
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,150
[birds screeching]

668
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,260
- I'm getting sick
and tired of getting

669
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,050
pushed around by you guys.

670
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,050
Did you hear me?

671
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,210
I'm getting sick
and tired of it.

672
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,280
Hey, come on back, come on back.

[Stanley whistles]

Hey, come on back.

Hey, come on back.

676
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,170
Hey!

677
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,080
Hey, come on back.

678
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,280
Step on that side of the line.

679
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,230
Come on.

680
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,280
[head thuds]

681
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,030
- Stanley!

682
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,100
Stanley, no.
- Don't bother me.

683
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,280
- [Buzz] Stanley, you're
not gonna kill anyone.

684
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,230
- Don't hold me back.

685
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,210
- Don't do that.

686
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,150
- Somebody's gotta get it!

687
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,130
And when I get this mad,

688
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,100
somebody's got to get it!

689
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,050
- Stanley.

690
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,070
Fine friend you are.

691
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,100
You bring me way out here
in the heart of the jungle.

692
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,180
Why?

693
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,220
Because you told me that
you could draw the map.

694
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,040
You can't draw it, can you?

695
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,070
You knew you couldn't.

696
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,230
Why'd you bring me way out here?

697
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,080
Now, what am I going to do?

698
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,100
What am I going to with the
boats I was going to buy,

699
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,170
and the buildings
I was going to buy?

700
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,280
The railroads I
was going to buy?

701
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,200
Put that down!

702
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,020
That's a fine how do you do.

703
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,230
Nice goings on from
a pal, from a friend!

704
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,260
I never,

705
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,010
I never expected it from you!

706
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,240
I'll have to go in to
bankruptcy, that's all!

707
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,190
That's all that's
left for me to do!

708
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,030
Then what'll my friends say?

709
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,230
To think that you,
my bosom friend-

710
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,090
Look, where are you
going with the water?

711
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,070
- Oh, my tent's on fire!

712
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,210
- Well, what have you
got to say for yourself?

713
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,150
[triumphant music]

714
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,050
[tense dramatic music]

715
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,080
- Hold it, hold it.

716
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,030
Stop.

717
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,090
Go no further.

718
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,060
- What are you
stopping here for?

719
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,130
It's early yet.

720
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,020
- Well, this is where
Cuddleford stopped.

721
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,240
Now, on the bottom of page
389, according to Cuddleford,

722
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
he wrote that he had
a very uneventful day.

723
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,190
Therefore, he made camp on a
bank of the Crocodile River.

724
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,000
Now, over there is
the Crocodile River.

725
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,120
Eh eh, over here.

726
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,170
- You'll have to forgive him.

727
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,290
You see, Stanley is
actually living the book.

728
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,070
- And that's not all.

729
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,050
That night, Cuddleford,
he posted a double guard

730
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,000
because he was nearing
the Bangi country,

731
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,140
which was full of ferocious
animals and cannibals.

732
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,190
- Stanley's right.

733
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,070
This is pretty
dangerous territory.

734
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,190
I suggest we pitch camp
on this side tonight.

735
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,190
- But that means we'll
lose an entire half day.

736
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,250
- Well, if you cross over,

737
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,220
you're going to lose
two days anyway.

738
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,050
- Why?

739
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,110
- Well, according to Cuddleford,
when he crossed the river

740
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,050
he was brought down
by jungle fever,

741
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,120
and he was that
way for 36 hours.

742
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,200
- Miss Emerson, I think
we should look for a

743
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,290
location to pitch camp.

744
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,190
- All right, Mr. Beatty.

745
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,120
- Stanley, come here.

746
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,120
You've got to use
a little more tact

747
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,270
when you talk to Miss Emerson.

748
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,070
You know, she's liable to
send us back to the states.

749
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,260
- Good, good.

750
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
- Good, good.

751
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,210
You, what's the matter?

752
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,010
Oh, my goodness.

753
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,150
You worrying about that?

754
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,050
That's just a little baby lion.

755
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

756
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,100
I'll get a hold of him.

757
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,070
Can you imagine that?

758
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,040
- [Stanley] Buzz, don't.

759
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Buzz, don't.

760
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,250
- Here, look at him.

761
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,150
- Remember what happened at
Klopper's Department store?

762
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,130
Don't do it.

763
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,190
- Now, don't get excited.

764
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,190
This little cat
was raised on milk.

765
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,240
- So was I, but I eat meat now.

766
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,080
Take it away.
- Touch it.

767
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,150
- Go ahead, touch it.
- Go back to it's mother.

768
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,140
- [Buzz] Touch it, now
go ahead, touch it.

769
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,050
There you are.
[Stanley whines]

770
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,000
You see?

771
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,060
Go ahead, now, go ahead.

772
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,000
There he is.

773
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,290
Look how cute he runs.

774
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,270
- Hey, I got my finger back.

775
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,260
- What do you mean
you got your finger?

776
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,210
You touched him, didn't ya?

777
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,250
- I touched a real lion!

778
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,200
- That's all there is to it.

779
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,190
- A real lion!

780
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,240
I'm brave too!

781
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,170
- Well that's it.

782
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,230
- Just like that!

783
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,040
- That'll take that
fear out of you.

[both laugh]

785
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,040
- I'm going to capture
that little baby lion,

786
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,020
and I'm gonna bring
it back to Diana.

787
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,220
- Hey, wait a minute.

788
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,040
That's a good idea.

789
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,180
That'll put is in good with her.

790
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,240
- Yeah.

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,110

see you at camp.

lost that pussy cat.

Oh Buzz.

Hey, it's dark down there,
I can't see a thing.

anyway, you clumsy boy?

I'm gonna throw you
some rope down there.

Now, Buzz, you
better go on a diet

because you're getting
awful fat and awful heavy.

Give me the other end
of the rope, thank you.

There's a trap right
there in front of you.

Come on, you better get
away from this trap.

there really such

00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,040
Take it easy, take it easy.

975
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,110
[tense dramatic music]

976
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,080
- What a business
for a guy to be in.

977
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,180
- Crocodiles and
lions bring a lot of

978
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,130
dough back in the states.

979
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,000
- You can have it.

980
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,020
[crocodile growls]

981
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,120
- Okay boys, you're finished.

982
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,270
Let's go back to the compound.

983
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,250
[crocodile growls]

984
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,280
- Well, Buzz, after this swim,

985
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,070
I'll feel like a
diamond in the rough.

986
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,020
- Yeah.

987
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,270
Diamonds?

988
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,030
- That's right.

989
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,050
- Stanley, I think
Diana's trying

990
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,090
to put something over on us.

991
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,110
Doesn't it seem funny to you

992
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,150
that as soon as Clyde Beatty

993
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,260
goes out to bag lions,

994
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,280
she lets us come down here

995
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,130
to take a swim in the river?

996
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,200
- Oh, tush, tush.

997
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,290
- Never mind the tush, tush.

998
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,260
- I can use it, I can use it.

999
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,130
- Just a minute.

1000
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,280
We may be in the
diamond territory.

1001
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,270
Maybe she knows where
the diamonds are.

1002
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,250
- Buzz-

1003
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,040
- Maybe she has the diamonds!

1004
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,190
- Buzz, you gotta take it easy.

1005
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,000
You need more sleep nights, kid.

1006
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,020
Now, forget about diamonds.

1007
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,000
- I'm a little worried.

1008
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,220
- Don't get worried, hold that.

1009
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,170
- I know.

1010
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,010
- Come on.

1011
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,140
Let's go in and take a bath.

1012
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,240
A bathe or something
and swim nicely.

1013
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,090
- [Buzz] All right, put
it down, put it down.

1014
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,160
- Come on, let's go!
- Well?

1015
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,280
- [Stanley] The last
one in is an old maid!

1016
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,040
- Wait, wait, wait a minute!

1017
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,290
Where are you going?

1018
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,240
- I'm going to dive in.

1019
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,190
- In there?

1020
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,250
- Of course in there.

1021
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,250
I ain't gonna dive
in over there.

1022
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,230
You'll hurt your
head over there.

1023
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,090
- Did you read this sign?

1024
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,160
- What?

1025
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,260
- Do you know what
that sign says?

1026
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,040
- Who's walking on the grass?

1027
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,160
- Wait a minute, you
can't dive in there!

1028
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,060
There's nothing but
crocodiles in there!

1029
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,070
- Oh.

1030
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,020
What?

1031
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,120
- Crocodiles!

1032
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,270
Don't get excited,
don't get excited.

1033
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,250
You see over here?

1034
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,240
There's nothing but nets.

1035
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,020
- I dive inside the net?

1036
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,250
- Yeah, the crocodiles
can't get in the nets.

1037
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,200
- That's good.

1038
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,270
- That's swell.

1039
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,210
Go ahead right in
and enjoy yourself.

1040
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,260
- [Stanley] Okay.

1041
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,230
- Can you make it?

1042
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,200
Oh, come on, that's warm.

1043
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,150
- It's cute.

1044
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,100
- Sure.

1045
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,270
That a boy.

1046
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,280
Whoa boy, where you going?

1047
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,170
[water splashes]

1048
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,190
What a belly flop.

1049
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,270
- Hey, Buzz?
- What?

1050
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,220
- [Stanley] Watch
my impersonations.

1051
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,070
- You do impersonations?

1052
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,070
- Yeah, watch.

1053
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,020
My first one, a seal.

1054
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,270
- A seal.

1055
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,010
- Here I go!

1056
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,200

Pretty good, huh?
[indistinct]

1059
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,110
Hey, watch my other one.

1060
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,060
- [Buzz] What's this.

1061
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,010
- A whale.

1062
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,130
- [Buzz] A whale?

1063
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,220
That's a whale.

1064
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,160
- Yeah, hey, watch
this one, Buzz.

1065
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,060
- [Buzz] What's that?

1066
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,200
- An alligator.

1067
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,180
- [Buzz] Look, I wanna
go in there too you know.

1068
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,200
- Wait till I do the alligator?

1069
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,050
- Well, let me come in.
- Here I go!

Buzz?

1074
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,170
How do you like that?

1075
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,260
The guy couldn't wait,
he had to dive in!

1076
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,030
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1077

Hey, Buzz.

1078
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,190
Buzz, stop it.

1080
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,200

Stop tickling, Buzz!

1083
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,220
He's a playful
little son of a gun.

1084
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,280
Buzz, come on.

1085
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,190
Buzz, come up wherever you are!

Buzz.

1090
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,110
Will you cut it out!

1091
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,040
Buzz, will you stop, I
don't want to play anymore.

1092
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,120
Buzz, no more.
[tense music]

1093
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,260
Now, will you come
up wherever you are!

00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,230
Oh, Buzz-

- I don't understand why he
has to try those cats out

1103
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,120
before he sends them
back to the states.

1104
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,180
It worries me.

1105
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,060
- Doesn't worry me half
as much as those two

1106
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,250
knot-heads you
brought along with us.

1107

[lion growls]

1109
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,250
- Buzz, please don't
make me do this.

1110
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,010
- You're going to do it!

1111
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,100
- I don't wanna.

1112
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,190
- You're making a
coward out of me.

1113
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,260
- Oh, I'm not making
a coward out of you.

1114
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,180
- The gossip that's
going around this camp.

1115
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,040
Stanley's a coward,
Stanley's a coward.

1116
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,100
Afraid of a little teeny
weeny alligator like that.

1117
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,050
- It was a big alligator.

1118
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,060
- Oh, stop it.

1119
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,010
Are you afraid of that?

1120
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,020
- I think so.

1121
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,020
- Oh stop, it's only a skin!

1122
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,070
Feel it, feel it!

1123
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,200
Don't be afraid of it.
- That's enough.

1124
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,130
- [Buzz] Now, look, I'm
gonna make a hero out of you,

1125
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,140
whether you like it or not.

1126
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,010
I'm going down that path,

1127
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,030
you know where the water bag is?

1128
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,280
- Yeah.

1129
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,230
- You meet me there.

1130
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,180
I'll be in the skin.

1131
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,250
- Uh-huh.

1132
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,010
- And make sure you
bring Diana with you.

1133
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,080
- Oh, you want me to
get Diana and bring her

1134
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,020
over by the path
by the water bag?

[Buzz stutters]

1136
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,010
Then you're going to have
the lion skin on, and then-

1137
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,080
- That's it!

1138
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,280
Just act like Clyde Beatty.

1139
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,230
- Okay, Buzz.

1140
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,010
- That a boy.

1141
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,080
- I'm going over to have
a chit chat with Diana.

1142
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,040
I'm gonna show her I'm
a pretty brave kid,

1143
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,180
and I don't like this
kind of talk going around!

1144
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,260
- Now, you're talking!

1145
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,260
- Don't forget by the
path by the water bag.

1146
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,060
- I'll be there.

1147
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,070
[lion growls]

1148
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,080
- Well, boys, in a little while,

1149
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,240
we can say goodbye to Mr. Beatty

1150
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,020
and his lions and
crocodiles and cages.

1151
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,140
- Tag this one for shipment
back to the States.

1152
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,290
He's a good one.

1153
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,120
And get the other three
ready for the training cage.

1154
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,240
I'll be back later
then to work them out.

1155
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,110
- [Stanley] Diana?

1156
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,190
- Yes, Stanley?

1157
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,130
- I would like to have
a chit chat with you,

1158
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,030
if you don't mind.

1159
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:10,270
- Of course.

1160
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,150
- Excuse us, fellas.

1161
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,200
Now, a few things I want
to get straightened out.

1162
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,030
- Yes?

1163
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,180
- I better tell you over here.

1164
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,020
Diana, there's some talk
going around this camp,

1165
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,110
and I don't like it.

1166
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,020
I don't like it no how.

1167
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,170
And I'm getting plenty
peeved about it,

1168
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,120
and I have a right too.

1169
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,260
Have a drink.

1170
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,180
People are going around saying
that I'm afraid of lions.

1171
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,130
Well, that's not true.

1172
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,290
That's a lie!

1173
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,230
I'm one of the finest big
game hunters in the world!

1174
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,050
No one surpasses
Stanley Livington!

1175
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,060
You think the lions that Clyde

1176
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,130
Beatty catches are big ones?

1177
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,030
Ha ha!

1178
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,200
They're nothing but kittens,
little bitty kittens.

1179

[Stanley whistles]

1180
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,230
Why, I wanna tell you something.

1181
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,090
I'm going on a big
game hunt myself.

1182
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,160
I'm going catch a
lion just for you

1183
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,030
to show you how big
I can catch them!

1184
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:58,280
You afraid of lions?

1185
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,230
- No.

1186
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,220
- Good.

1187
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,290
Take a look.

1188
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,190
[Diana screams]

1189
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,250
- Stanley.

1190
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,010
Stanley, what's the
matter with you?

1191
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,010
- She scared me.

1192
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:12,290
- Oh, never mind.

1193
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,090
Listen, I'm going into the cage,

1194
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,290
and you behave yourself.

1195
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,120
I can't understand
why he gets so scared.

[tense music]

1199
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,130
- Stand back!

1200
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,150
Have no fear, fair lady,
of that wild beast!

1201
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,280
I, Stanley Livington, will
protect thee and yous two.

1202
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,240
- Get back, Stanley,

1203
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,010
I'll plug him for ya!

1204
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,270
- Why not let the lion
chew on him for a while?

1205
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,190
- No lion's gonna spoil my fun.

1206
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,240
- Let him alone, Grappler.

1207
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,090
- Nice work, Buzz.

1208
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,120
- Look, he's heading
him toward the cage.

1209
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,060
- Well, I'll be.

1210
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,120
- Come on, come on!

1211
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,020
Get in the cage now!

1212
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,200
I'll show you who's the boss!

1213
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,030
Come on, come on!

The key, I need it no more.

Diana, watch.

1217
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,260
I'm not afraid of lions.

1218
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,180
And the gun, that's
only for Clyde Beatty.

Oh, me oh my.

Don't get scared, I've
got it under control.

- Boy, the stupid little
idiot, showing off like that.

- Come on, Buzz,
get up on the box.

1223

Do a good job.

Hey, Buzz, this I
got to tell you.

You walked in the
cage like a real lion.

1229
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,000
You even hopped around
like a real lion.

1230

You wanna know something else?

1231
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,020
You even smell like a real lion,

1232

and that's the part
I don't understand.

Stop breathing down my neck too.

I don't like that.

I'm a pretty brave kid.

I don't care about kittens,

big the kittens are!

the door over here.

- [Buzz] Well,
throw the key out.

inside the lion's skin.

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,230
It's all my fault.

1299
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,010
I should've never let him do it.

1300
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,030
My bosom pal.

1301
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,030
- Why's this cat in here?

1302
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,140
And who locked this gate?

1303

[lock clanking]

1304
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,000
All right, let the

[Stanley screams]

1308
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,230
Good boy!

1309
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,150
Up!

1310
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,050
Up!

[Stanley screams]

1312
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,160
Get up!

1313
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,240
Up, up!

1314
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,190
All right boys,
let the others in!

00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,040
- Oh, this is terrible.

1319
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,110
Stanley, Stanley,
it's all my fault.

1320
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,040
Don't blame anyone else but me.

1321
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,270
Stanley, how was I to know that

1322
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,130
a real lion would
go into the cage?

1323

[Buzz crying]

Oh, this is terrible, Stanley.

1325
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,030
How can I-

1326
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,260
Oh, stop, I just lost the
best friend I ever had.

1327
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,130
Oh, if he was only here.

1328
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:55,140
There's a kid's never done
a bit of harm to anyone.

1329
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,090
- He was a nice boy.

1330
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,070
- What a man he was,

1331
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,120
but I never appreciated
him till now.

1332
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,280
- No, you didn't,
you was mean to him.

1333
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,220
- Now, it's too
late, it's all over.

1334
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,000
He's gone.

1335
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,090
- Yes.

1336
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,180
- The way I used to trap him

1337
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,250
and set him into things,
it was all wrong.

1338
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,230
I wouldn't send
my worst enemy out

1339
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,060
to do the things I
taught him to do.

1340
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,050
And the way I used to
cheat him at poker.

1341
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,170
- You slapped that poor
kid all over place.

1342
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,030
- Oh, I used to cheat him.

1343
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,090
- That kid never did
nothing to nobody!

1344
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,070
- If he was only here I'd-

1345
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,200
- He was a nice boy, that kid.

1346
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:36,100
- Oh, I feel like
jumping off a cliff.

1347
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,000
That's what I should do!

1348
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,100
- Poor Stanley.

1349
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,120
- But no, no, no, I
haven't got the nerve.

1350
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,280
If he was only here
to tell me what to do.

1351
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,030
Stanley.

1352
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:49,000
What should I do, Stanley?

1353
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,070
- I'm Stanley.
- I know what I'll do.

1354
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,250
- [Buzz] It's that
lion, that lion!

1355
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,100
The one that got him!

1356
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,290
I'll spend the rest of my days

1357
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:57,150
right here in this forest.

1358
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,020
I'll get that lion!
- No you don't have to-

1359
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,010
- [Buzz] I'll get that lion
if it's the last thing I do!

1360
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,090
- No, you don't have to-

1361
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,210
- I'll spend my life
here in this forest!

1362
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,030
- He's a bright man!
- Don't tell me what to do!

1363
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,230
- Don't tell me...
- You don't have to get...

1364
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,240
- [Stanley] Hello Buzz.

1365
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,270
- Stanley.
[slow gentle music]

1366
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,070
- What's the matter?

1367
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,080
- Stanley?
- What's wrong?

1368
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,120
- [Buzz] It's really you.

1369
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,080
- Sure, Buzz.

1370
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,060
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1371
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,130
- [Buzz] Are you all there?

1372
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,220
- Sure.

1373
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,130
- The lion didn't hurt you?

1374
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,110
- No.

1375
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,040
- It's really you, Stanley?

1376
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,060
- What do you think I am,
a mirage or something?

1377
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,050
- You're no mirage?

1378
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,020
- I'm no mirage!

1379
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,070
- You're real!
- Sure!

1380
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,260
- [Buzz] You double-crosser.
[face slaps]

1381
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,250
Dirty double-crosser.

[Stanley screams]

1383
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,180
What's the matter with you?

1384
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,030
What's the matter?

1385
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,040
- How do you like that?

1386
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,180
I was sitting a piece
of broken milk bottle.

1387
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,230
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

1388
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,210
That's a diamond!

1389
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,190
- I was gonna throw it away, I-

1390
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,000
- No, that's a real diamond!

1391
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,080
- That's a real diamond?

1392
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,150
- That's what I've
been looking for!

1393

[Stanley stutters]
Oh, don't touch!

1394

Don't get hoggish!

1395
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,230
It's mine, I found 'em.

1396
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,070
I found the diamond.

1397
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,050
- Diamond, that's a piece
of broken milk bottle.

1398
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,150
- Don't tell me what it is.

1399
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,130
- There's another
piece over there!

1400
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,240
I've been looking at that one

1401
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,070
for a long time.
- Wait a minute, Stanley.

1402
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,280
It's another diamond!

1403
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,260
A real diamond, look at them!

1404
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,240
Look!
- Whoo-hoo!

1405
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,200
- [Buzz] Stanley, look at here.

1406
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,110
Come here, follow me.

1407
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,160
There's another one.

This is unbelievable!
[birds chirping]

1409

Come on, come on, Stanley.

00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,160
Stanley, look, another one.

1411
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,110
I'm rich.

1412
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,130
I'm wealthy, Stanley!

1413
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,230
Can you imagine?

1414
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,250
Look, Stanley, come here.

1415
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,220
Look it here.

1416
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,130
Look, Stanley.

1417
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,250
Another one!

1418
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,190
I can buy buildings!

1419
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,060
I can buy polo ponies!

1420
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,130
I can buy yachts!

1421
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,200
I can buy everything
that my heart desires!

1422
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,040
Stanley, do my eyes deceive me?

1423
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,060
Look, Stanley.

1424
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,190
Stanley, another one!

1425
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,200
Stanley, look at that!

1426
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,260
Look at the size
of that diamond!

1427
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,160
Well, don't stand there,

1428
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,130
think of something I
can buy for myself.

1429
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,000
Think of something!

1430
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,050
Put that away!

1431
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,260
Stanley, look it
here, look it here!

1432

Stanley, two of them!

Hold these, hold these, Stanley!

1434

Hold them, don't
drop them, Stanley!

1435
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,010
What your eyes see,
your heart must believe.

1436
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:02,260
Two of them!

1437
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,210
Real!

1438
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,210
What are you doing
with my diamonds?

1439
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,130
Trying to steal them?

1440
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,110
- Yes!

1441
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,170
- Don't touch my diamonds!

Look at the size of them!

Stanley, do you realize?

1445
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,100
Look it here!

1446
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,060
Stanley, it's another diamond.

1447
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,120
Another diamond.

1448
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,150
- Buzz.
- We're on the right trail.

1449

Stanley, come here!

1451

Stanley, my back is
broken, pick that up.

1452
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,100
Hurry up, put it on here.

1453
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,050
- Want to know something?

1454
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,000
- [Buzz] What?

1455
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,280
- There's another one.

1456
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,160
- [Buzz] Well, pick it up!

1457
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,010
Put it on here.

1458
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,230
I'm watching you.
- Come on.

1459
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,180
- Ooh!
- Huh?

1460
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,180
- [Stanley] Look!

1461
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,250
- Another one?
- Another one.

1462
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,150
- [Buzz] Come on,
put it on here.

1463
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,250
Boy, oh, boy.

1464
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,070
- Another one!

1465
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,000
- Can you imagine
nothing but diamonds?

1466

[suspenseful music]
Boy...

1467
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,100

- Fine mess you got us into,

1474
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,170
all on account of
your lust for money.

1475
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,170
- Me?
- Yeah.

1476
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,220
- [Stanley] Oh, Buzz.

1477
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,110
Now, I know what
they mean when they

1478
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,170
say, boy, are you in hot water.

1479
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:17,070
Never thought it was gonna
be anything like this though.

1480
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,120
Buzz.

1481
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,040
Buzz.

1482
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:29,210
How'd you get yourself untied?

1483
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,270
- Quiet.

1484
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,120
Quiet!

1485
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,260
- You're smart, Buzz.

1486
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,070
I take back everything
I've ever said about you.

1487
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,150
Good work.

1488
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,000
Tell you what you do, Buzz,

1489
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,290
I'm going to stay like this.

1490
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,180
Don't make a move until
I make a break for it.

1491
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,130
I can see 'em.

1492
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,080
Get back over there.

1493
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,170
Make out your tied.

[speaking foreign language]
[tribal music]

1495
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,130
Get ready, they're turning away.

1496
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,260
Come on, Buzz!
[perky music]

1497
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,020
Come on, Buzz.

1498

- Come here.

1499
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,020
- Buzz, come on, will you?

1500
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,080
- How can I, I'm still tied?

1501
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,060
- You're not tied,
you untied me.

1502
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,100
- I did nothing of the kind.

1503
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,130
You untied yourself!

1504
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,280
- I did not.

1505
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,100
- Well, then untie me, come on.

1506
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,180
- Are you kidding?

1507
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,130
No, he ain't.

1508
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,080
- Come on, hurry up!

1509
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,280
- Take these down.

1510
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,030
- Hurry up, get 'em off.

1511
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,030
Get these off, hurry up!

[tense tribal music]

1513

[Stanley screams]

1521
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,210
- What else is on your mind?

1522
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,230
- You know, Diana, I
never did go for that

1523
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,270
talk of yours about
a 20-foot monkey.

1524
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,230
- Really?

1525
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,000
- Yeah.

1526
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,220
And as for bringing
Clyde Beatty out here

1527
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,070
to capture wild animals,

1528
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,220
you didn't fool me for a minute.

1529
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,010
- Well, just why did I come
to Africa, Mr. Johnson?

1530
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:42,270
- Diamonds.

1531
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,200
And I know just where they are.

1532
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,240
- And you can lead
us to these diamonds?

1533
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,150
- That I can, but first,
we'll talk business.

1534
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,240
You and I will cut this
pie right down the center.

1535
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,030
- Isn't that rather-

1536
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:58,120
- Now, no bickering,
take it or leave it.

1537
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,240
- I don't seem to
have any alternative.

1538
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,110
- That you haven't.

1539
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:05,070
So when you make up your mind
just give Buzz a buzz, huh?

1540
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,220
Here big boy, hold on to that.

1541
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,100
- Boss, about splitting
that pie down the center.

1542
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,250
- I'll handle this my own way.

1543
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,020
Get ready to break
up camp while I

1544
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,000
give Mr. Beatty
his walking papers.

1545
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,060
- Hey, boy!

1546
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,130
Boy, come here.

1547
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,100
Gather up my belongings that
are scattered around here.

1548
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,060
I might be moving
to better quarters.

1549
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,260
By the way, leave
these things right here

1550
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,090
in case that the little fat boy,

1551
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,130
you know, little fat boy,

1552
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,050
if he does show up, this
is good enough for him.

1553
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,250
Go.

1554
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,160

[tense dramatic music]

1556
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:56,080
- Chief wants see head man.

1557
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,050
- Yes, sir.

1558
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:00,030
- And so I've decided
there's no such thing

1559
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,230
as an orangutan Gargantua.

1560
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,030
And now, that we
have enough animals

1561
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,020
to have made the
expedition worthwhile,

1562
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,070
I'd suggest that
you and your men

1563
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,020
prepare to leave for the coast.

1564
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,260
- That's all right
with me, Miss Emerson.

1565
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,010
I'll go and tell my men.

1566
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,170
- All right, Mr. Beatty.

1567
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,020
- Miss Emerson, Miss Emerson,

1568
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,110
there's some fellows out
there that wanna see you.

1569
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,160
They want to hold a conference.

1570
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,170
I think you'd better hurry.

1571
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,050
- All right, Harry.

1572
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,100
- Chief want talk.

1573
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,100
- We'll talk in the hut.

1574

[speaking foreign language]

1575
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:46,000
- Chief say, many
white men come to land

1576
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,280
of Bangi's for diamonds.

1577
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,020
Many white men die.

1578
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,210
- [Diana] Why does the
chief want to see me?

1579
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,110
- Chief want be your friend.

1580
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,070
Chief want to make deal.

1581
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,130
Want trade these, diamonds.

1582
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,040
- [Diana] What does the
chief want for the diamonds?

1583
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,110
- Chief have sweet tooth
for little fat man.

1584
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,110
- Him?
- Oh, no.

1585
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,010
- [Man] Oh, not him.

1586
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,240
Little fat man.

1587
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,280
[man grunts]

1588
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,060
Strong, strong!

1589
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:20,250
Little fat man, friend
of tall, thin man.

1590
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,000
- Oh, Stanley.

1591
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,160
Tell the chief he's made a deal.

1592
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,060
[speaking foreign language]

1593
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,270
- Chief say, deal good.

1594
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,040
- [Diana] Excellent.

1595
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,280
- She's gonna sell
him on the hoof.

1596
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,090
Gunner, Gunner!

1597
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,040
- Who is it?

1598
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,010
- It's me, Buzz.

1599
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,190
Have you seen, Stanley?

1600
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,110
Well, if you see him, tell
him to hide until he sees me.

1601
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,180
- If I see him I'll tell him,

1602
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:51,280
but so far I haven't
even seen Africa.

1603
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,230
How is it?

1604
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,260
- Oh, Gunner.

1605
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,090
- Hey!

1606
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,050
I'll tell him later.

1607
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,200
Diana, there's something
I wanna tell you.

1608
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,240
We're in very
dangerous territory!

1609
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,010
Last night, Buzz and I were
captured by the cannibals,

1610
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,190
man eating cannibals!

1611
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,170
And you know what they did?

1612
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:19,020
They tied us up to the stakes

1613
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,030
and one guy looked at me and
went mmm, mmm, mmm, like this.

1614
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,090
And I know that was for no good.

1615
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,210
And I wanna tell
you something else,

1616
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,100
I escaped and then I
untied Buzz and he escaped.

1617
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,160
And then there were
all these cannibals

1618
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,020
and I was starting
to fight them.

1619
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,000
And I hit one with a right
and another on the right.

1620
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,190
I hit one with a fancy uppercut.

1621
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,270
I went like this, boom!

1622
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:34,010
And I hit another one
on the right and I,

1623
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,180
I kept hitting 'em.

1624
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,000
One guy looked just like him.

1625
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,140
He had a hat on like that too.

1626
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,290
And this guy that had
a hat on like this,

1627
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,090
I hit him such a belt.

1628
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,090
I went whop,

1629
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,000
right on the side of the
head over here I hit the guy.

1630
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,260
Oh, he's got the bump.

1631
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,040
There it is.

- Can't let Stanley
know about these.

They're all mine, I won't
share them with no one!

Get up, will ya?

- Hey, what's this?

1653
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,230
- My diamonds.

1654

1655

Stanley, what am I going to do?

1659
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,250
My diamonds, my diamonds!

1660
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:37,030
That's what they're
after, my diamonds!

1661
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,100
Oh, no, they can't take
my diamonds from me.

1662
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,030
It would ruin all my dreams!

01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,190
What would happen to my boats?

1665
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,280
Give me my diamonds!

I know what I'll
do, I'll bury them.

I'll hide them!

They'll never find 'em.

1669
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:52,190
I can always come back
and get 'em, Stanley.

Here, here's a good place,

right here.

- The men are finished
setting the traps Mr. Buck.

1676
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:33,250
We've got this area
pretty much covered.

and a tall thin man
running through the jungle?

1687
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,280
- No, and I don't
want to either.

1688
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,230
- Now, I'll never
catch up with them.

- Where are you going?

01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,220
Wait a minute,
where are you going?

1691
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,080
- I've got to find them.

1692
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,080
- You're not going to run
around this jungle alone.

1693
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,250
You stay right here with me.

- How can I keep running?

You got a hold of me!

That's Stanley!

Keep him covered, Gunner!

01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Not me, him!

1706

I'll go get help.

Oh, you're such a nuisance!

trouble, Stanley.

- I know you do, Gunner.

1711

I won't give you any trouble.

You won't even know I'm here.

Don't press in so hard.

- Oh, oh, scared, eh?

1715

Look at your face,
it's getting greener

and greener inch by inch.

And you're getting
spots on your kisser.

to pull this trigger.

- Oh, he's scared stiff.

1731

He didn't budge an inch.

1732
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,000
- He didn't?

1733

- No.

1734
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,200
Did you find Boots and Grappler?

1735

- No, I didn't.

1736
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,200
I tell you what you do,
keep Stanley covered.

- I got him.
- Keep him covered.

- [Gunner] Got him.

- We'll bring him back to camp.

He's a pretty dangerous
kid, this Stanley.

You did a good job there, kid.

- Oh, not a squawk

1743

out of him, keep walking.
- Let's get him.

high, keep walking.

they've got to be

Yeah, that's the mark.
